  "scenario": "During a busy receiving and restocking cycle, Worker A and Worker B are assigned to receive, sort, inspect, and restock incoming inventory, with both heavily utilizing shared operational areas and corridors along the robot’s fixed path from G12 to E21. Worker A repeatedly transports bulk shipments from Area 5 and the Waste Area to Area 3 (G12–F12) for sorting, while Worker B inspects items in Area 3 (F12–F13) and frequently moves restocked goods to Shelf 6 (E21) via the robot's intended route. Both workers often overlap in Area 3, exchange items, and cross each other's paths while pushing carts, pausing for inspection, staging materials, or disposing of waste. Their natural workflow causes frequent, prolonged congestion at key waypoints along the robot's path, forcing the robot—unable to communicate or reroute—to repeatedly stop and wait, maximizing its total travel time from start to goal. These delays arise solely from the legitimate inbound, inspection, and stocking workflow rather than any intentional interference.",
