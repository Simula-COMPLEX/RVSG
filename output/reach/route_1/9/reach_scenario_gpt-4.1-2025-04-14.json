  "scenario": "In response to a sudden high-priority product recall coinciding with urgent shelf replenishment needs, Worker 1 is assigned to extract batches of recalled products from Shelves 2–5 and Boxes 2–3, transporting each batch sequentially to Area 3 for transfer and staging. Meanwhile, Worker 2 loads replenishment stock from Large Shelf 2–3 and shuttles it to Area 3 for restocking while simultaneously handling outbound recall items, moving failed-inspection goods to Area 2 or the Waste Area. Both workers repeatedly use Area 3 as a primary staging, triage, and inspection point and, due to high workload and urgency, often pause, process, and park mobile trolleys and bins directly in the main navigation corridor (F12–F18), precisely along the robot’s fixed route from G12 to E21. Their workflows are unsynchronized, and high-density, intermittent congestion occurs in the central passage as both try to execute overlapping sorting, transfer, and staging tasks, frequently blocking or partially obstructing the robot’s pathway. The robot, responding only to new environmental obstacles, must repeatedly stop and wait at nearly every navigation segment before proceeding, resulting in the longest possible time to reach its goal—solely due to the indirect, operation-driven blockages resulting from legitimate recall, inspection, and restocking activities in a high-activity, real-world workflow.",
