  "scenario": "After a major supplier recall, two workers are tasked with simultaneous large-scale restock and urgent defective-return processing, creating high-volume, unpredictable congestion along the robot’s fixed navigation route (G12 to E21). Worker 1 collects restock bins from Area 3 and moves repeatedly along the main corridor, pausing to inventory-check, shuffle, and restock goods across Shelves 4–6, frequently leaving trolleys mid-path or staging boxes directly within the passage (F12–F21). At the same time, Worker 2 transports batches of returned goods from Area 5 to Area 3 for inspection and sorting, frequently stopping to examine, label, or transfer defective items, then pushes bins toward Area 2 (for rework) or the Waste Area—often parking loaded carts, staging defective boxes, or completing paperwork within the robot’s navigation corridor. Their workflows regularly overlap at Area 3 and in the primary aisle, with both workers (and their equipment) unintentionally blocking key waypoints through frequent, large-volume movements, pause-and-process events, and mid-transfer crossovers. As neither can foresee or avoid the other’s interruptions, and both are driven by urgent, legitimate workflow needs, the robot—reacting only to the evolving physical environment—experiences repeated, unpredictable obstructions throughout its assigned path. This unique, recall-driven operational surge produces the longest possible robot travel time from G12 to E21, rooted solely in necessary restock and defective-return workflows and complex, indirect human-induced congestion.",
