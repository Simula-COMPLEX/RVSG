  "scenario": "In the midst of an end-of-quarter audit and error recovery initiative, a two-person warehouse team executes a cyclical, multi-stage repack, rework, and quality hold process. Worker 1 retrieves damaged, mislabeled, or mispacked items from Boxes 1–3, Large Shelf 1, and Shelves 1–2, transporting them to Area 3 for focused rework, then relabeling in Area 2 or disposal in the Waste Area. Worker 2, meanwhile, removes high-return or QA-hold goods from Shelves 4–6 and Large Shelves 2–4, cycles them through Area 3 for inspection, then shuttles them between Area 4 (for QA-hold) and possible relabeling in Area 2, repeating as needed. Both workers routinely, but asynchronously, use carts and bins, frequently staging or working side-by-side in Area 3 and its bordering corridors (G12, F12–F21, F17–F21, E18–E21), leaving temporary obstacles, mobile carts, and rework bins in the robot’s path. Neither workflow is synchronized, and both involve multiple, unpredictable transitions in and out of the robot’s fixed navigation corridor. As a result, the robot—executing a fixed G12→E21 route and able only to react to new obstacles—must wait through repeated, unscheduled human-caused blockages, often facing multiple physical interferences at various points along its path. This high-frequency, multi-directional congestion makes the robot’s journey as slow as operationally possible, resulting in the maximum total time spent traversing its assigned path before reaching Shelf 6.",
