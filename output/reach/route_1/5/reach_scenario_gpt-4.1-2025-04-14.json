  "scenario": "During a high-volume outbound and multi-order repacking cycle, both Worker 1 and Worker 2 perform synchronized, interdependent workflows that require near-constant movement, staging, and staging rework in the central corridor used by the robot’s fixed navigation path (G12 to E21). Worker 1 retrieves and assembles mixed pallets from Areas 1 and large shelves, staging goods along columns 12–17, and frequently pausing to group, scan, or wait for QA checks. Simultaneously, Worker 2 cycles between Shelf 6, Area 4, and Area 2 to process quality holds and returns, extracting items for relabeling or disposal and regularly reworking or intercepting parcels in the same central lane. Mobile pallet jacks, carts, worktables, and partial loads are frequently parked across the lane as both workers move in, out, and repeatedly return to the same points—creating sustained, overlapping blockages and unpredictable cross-traffic in the robot route. The combined workflow results in the central aisle functioning as a continuous shared processing, staging, and quality hold area, causing the robot—unable to reroute or communicate—to stop and wait at nearly every navigation segment. This operationally realistic surge scenario, with high-frequency synchronized cycles and sustained co-occupation of the robot's path, ensures the robot’s travel time is maximized solely through the necessary execution of parallel human workflows, fundamentally distinct from any prior scenario.",
