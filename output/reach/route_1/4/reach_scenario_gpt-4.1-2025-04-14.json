  "scenario": "During an afternoon marked by simultaneous scheduled cycle counting and unplanned bulk returns processing, Worker A performs detailed reconciliation and inventory corrections along Shelves 2–5 while Worker B manages urgent returns arrival at Area 5, transporting unsorted items to Area 3 for joint sorting with Worker A. Both workers repeatedly cross the robot’s fixed navigation route (G12 → E21) with carts, bins, and inventory, alternating between shelving, recounts, sorting, and disposal (Waste Area or Shelf 6). Their overlapping use of Area 3 and the main corridor creates unpredictable, prolonged blockages and bidirectional congestion at nearly every waypoint on the robot’s path, especially near Area 3 and Shelf 6. As neither worker is aware of or coordinates with the robot, the persistent presence of people and objects along the central corridor forces the robot to repeatedly wait at multiple points, significantly increasing its total travel time to the goal. All delays arise from genuine, high-priority operations where shared workspace, side-by-side processing, and frequent two-way movement are operationally required, maximizing the indirect disruption to the navigating robot.",
