  "scenario": "During a late-day outbound surge, two workers simultaneously perform parallel order picking and packing for dispatch, both converging on Area 3 (G12–F14) as a shared order consolidation and packing point. Worker 1 repeatedly collects large or bulk items from Large Shelves (L/M14–M17) and Shelf 3–4 (E14–E17), transporting them via carts through columns 12–17—directly along the robot’s fixed path. Worker 2 retrieves small goods from Shelves 5–6 (E18–E21), gathers packaging supplies from Area 2 (F16–F17), and brings them to Area 3 for order assembly and packing. Both workers frequently access the same functional area at the same time for packing and order finalization, while also returning together or individually to retrieve bins or remove waste across key waypoints in F12–F21, creating repeated, unpredictable blockages along the robot's navigation route. High levels of task, spatial, and timing overlap cause persistent congestion in the robot's lane, requiring it to repeatedly stop and wait without rerouting or communication, resulting in the longest possible time to reach its destination from G12 to E21, all arising naturally from urgent order fulfillment workflows in the constraints of the warehouse layout.",
