    "summary": "During a busy receiving and restocking cycle, Worker A and Worker B are assigned to receive, sort, inspect, and restock incoming inventory, with both heavily utilizing shared operational areas and corridors along the robot’s fixed path from G12 to E21. Worker A repeatedly transports bulk shipments from Area 5 and the Waste Area to Area 3 (G12–F12) for sorting, while Worker B inspects items in Area 3 (F12–F13) and frequently moves restocked goods to Shelf 6 (E21) via the robot's intended route. Both workers often overlap in Area 3, exchange items, and cross each other's paths while pushing carts, pausing for inspection, staging materials, or disposing of waste. Their natural workflow causes frequent, prolonged congestion at key waypoints along the robot's path, forcing the robot—unable to communicate or reroute—to repeatedly stop and wait, maximizing its total travel time from start to goal. These delays arise solely from the legitimate inbound, inspection, and stocking workflow rather than any intentional interference.",

Both workers frequently access the same functional area at the same time for packing and order finalization, while also returning together or individually to retrieve bins or remove waste across key waypoints in F12–F21, creating repeated, unpredictable blockages along the robot's navigation route. High levels of task, spatial, and timing overlap cause persistent congestion in the robot's lane, requiring it to repeatedly stop and wait without rerouting or communication, resulting in the longest possible time to reach its destination from G12 to E21, all arising naturally from urgent order fulfillment workflows in the constraints of the warehouse layout.",

Worker 2, meanwhile, removes high-return or QA-hold goods from Shelves 4–6 and Large Shelves 2–4, cycles them through Area 3 for inspection, then shuttles them between Area 4 (for QA-hold) and possible relabeling in Area 2, repeating as needed. Both workers routinely, but asynchronously, use carts and bins, frequently staging or working side-by-side in Area 3 and its bordering corridors (G12, F12–F21, F17–F21, E18–E21), leaving temporary obstacles, mobile carts, and rework bins in the robot’s path. Neither workflow is synchronized, and both involve multiple, unpredictable transitions in and out of the robot’s fixed navigation corridor. As a result, the robot—executing a fixed G12→E21 route and able only to react to new obstacles—must wait through repeated, unscheduled human-caused blockages, often facing multiple physical interferences at various points along its path.

Both workers repeatedly cross the robot’s fixed navigation route (G12 → E21) with carts, bins, and inventory, alternating between shelving, recounts, sorting, and disposal (Waste Area or Shelf 6). Their overlapping use of Area 3 and the main corridor creates unpredictable, prolonged blockages and bidirectional congestion at nearly every waypoint on the robot’s path, especially near Area 3 and Shelf 6. As neither worker is aware of or coordinates with the robot, the persistent presence of people and objects along the central corridor forces the robot to repeatedly wait at multiple points, significantly increasing its total travel time to the goal.

Mobile pallet jacks, carts, worktables, and partial loads are frequently parked across the lane as both workers move in, out, and repeatedly return to the same points—creating sustained, overlapping blockages and unpredictable cross-traffic in the robot route. The combined workflow results in the central aisle functioning as a continuous shared processing, staging, and quality hold area, causing the robot—unable to reroute or communicate—to stop and wait at nearly every navigation segment.
