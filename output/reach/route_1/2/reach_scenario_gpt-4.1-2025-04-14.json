  "scenario": "During a scheduled inventory reconciliation and bin changeover, Worker A and Worker B conduct physically overlapping, high-frequency material movements between bulk storage (Boxes 1–3), routine shelves (Shelves 2–6), and operational Areas 1–3. Both workers independently and cooperatively shuttle inventory, count items, swap bins, and return goods along the main navigation corridor, converging repeatedly in Area 3 for verification—often with carts or pallets in tow. Multiple handoff, recount, and disposal steps require the workers to cross, pause, or station objects precisely along the robot’s fixed route (G12 to E21). This creates persistent, dense congestion and random pauses at critical waypoints, forcing the robot to halt and wait for frequent, unpredictable intervals. The delays are an unavoidable outcome of the legitimate, high-frequency cycle of counting, bin exchange, and cross-verification in a mid-audit warehouse workflow, with the workflow’s structure and spatial overlap maximizing the robot’s total time to traverse its assigned path.",
