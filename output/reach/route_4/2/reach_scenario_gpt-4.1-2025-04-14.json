  "scenario": "A rare, high-intensity warehouse operation occurs where outbound dispatch staging and returns processing are handled in parallel, causing both human workers to repeatedly traverse and occupy the main corridors and area entrances along the robot's fixed path (M5 to H17). Worker 1 cycles between Large Shelf 1, Boxes 3, Shelf 4/5, and Area 4, pausing frequently with a large cart to consolidate outbound orders, causing major blockages in the shared aisles. Worker 2 handles high-volume returns: collecting from Boxes 2, sorting in Area 2, repeatedly bringing inspected or rejected items to Area 4 or the Waste Area, and frequently pausing or staging tote bins at intersections. Both workers’ legitimate workflows lead them to simultaneously or alternately block narrow choke points and major waypoints on the robot's path, including frequent presence and temporary unattended carts in the Area 4 staging zone. With no direct human-robot interaction and the robot reacting purely to environmental obstacles, its progress is maximally delayed at nearly every critical node, resulting in the longest possible total time to destination, all due to authentic, overlapping warehouse activities.",
