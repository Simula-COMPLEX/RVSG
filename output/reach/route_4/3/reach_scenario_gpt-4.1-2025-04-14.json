  "scenario": "During an unscheduled high-intensity period involving both triage of damaged/returned goods and emergency shelf replenishment, Worker 1 repeatedly carts returns from Boxes 1 and 2 to Area 2 for inspection, then hauls waste to the Waste Area, regularly staging wide carts across key robot path waypoints (K6–K9–J9). Simultaneously, Worker 2 continually restocks Shelf 3 and Shelf 4 from Large Shelf 2 and Area 4, moving bulky totes along corridors that overlap the robot’s route (K9–K13–I14–I16–H16–H17), often pausing or staging totes at these choke points. The genuine operational needs of both workers lead to persistent, overlapping obstructions and mobile object congestion at nearly all critical segments of the robot’s fixed path (M5 to H17). With the robot responding solely to dynamic, activity-driven environmental blockages—not to commands or direct interaction—it must repeatedly stop and wait, resulting in the longest possible time to reach its goal, due to a perfect storm of realistic, workflow-based congestion.",
