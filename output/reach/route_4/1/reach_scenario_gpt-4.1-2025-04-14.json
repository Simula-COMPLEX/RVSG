  "scenario": "During a synchronized end-of-shift replenishment and inventory reconciliation, Worker 1 performs multiple long-haul bulk stock moves from Large Shelf 1 and Boxes 1 to replenish shelves and staging areas, repeatedly traversing the main central corridors aligned with the robot’s fixed route (M5 to H17). Simultaneously, Worker 2 audits shelves, operational areas, and disposes items to the Waste Area, frequently moving perpendicularly and pausing with a handcart across the same navigation spine and at key transition points. Both workers’ legitimate, high-frequency movements, crossovers, and temporary staging of pallets and carts cause frequent, prolonged blockages at the robot’s route entry, central, and exit waypoints. The robot, reacting only to environmental obstructions, is forced to repeatedly stop and wait along nearly its entire fixed path due to the realistically complex and congested environment, resulting in the longest possible time to reach its goal.",
