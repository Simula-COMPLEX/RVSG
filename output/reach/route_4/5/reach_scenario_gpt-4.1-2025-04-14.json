  "scenario": "During a sudden surge in urgent outbound and ad-hoc inbound orders, Worker 1 conducts high-frequency partial-pallet consolidation—moving between Large Shelf 1, Large Shelf 4, and Boxes 3 to assemble customer-tailored pallets, pausing and staging loads at every major turn (M5, L6, K9, K13, K17, H17), sometimes leaving carts or pallets temporarily in shared corridors. Worker 2 simultaneously executes emergency cross-docking: receiving high-priority inbound goods at Area 3, rapidly sorting, then moving them to Area 4 and Large Shelf 2, while frequently doubling back through central corridors and pausing with totes/bins at intersections (K11, K13, H16, H17). The overlapping, dynamic workflows and continuous, legitimate use of the robot’s navigation spine—together with unpredictable staging of loads and containers at every critical segment—generate naturally shifting, high-frequency obstructions and force the robot to repeatedly stop along its fixed route (M5 to H17). The robot, reacting only to environmental blockages, experiences the longest possible completion time, as both workers’ real tasks consistently occupy, block, or narrow all corridor waypoints and the eventual goal area at different moments.",
