Worker B concurrently conducts inspection and sorting in Areas 1 and 2, then moves sorted items to Area 4, passing through and occasionally staging equipment in the same corridors. Both workers frequently converge, wait, or handle goods at critical waypoints, naturally causing recurring obstructions and congestion in the robot’s route (M5 to H17). The robot, programmed to respond only to detected obstacles, must repeatedly stop and wait until pathways are clear. Legitimate workflow causes repeated environmental blockages along the entire path, maximizing the robot's total travel time to its goal.",
