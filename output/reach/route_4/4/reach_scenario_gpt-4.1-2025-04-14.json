  "scenario": "During a peak reverse logistics and urgent reuse operation, Worker 1 conducts high-frequency bulk returns and removal, cycling returned/faulty goods from Large Shelf 1 and Large Shelf 3 through Area 2 for rapid sorting and then to the Waste Area, repeatedly staging a wide cart across major waypoints (L6–K9–J9). At the same time, Worker 2 manages rolling urgent repackaging, inspecting Worker 1's batches in Area 2 and shuttling repackaged items to Large Shelf 4 or Boxes 1, frequently traversing and pausing with totes or partially packed bins across the same central corridors and choke points as the robot's fixed path (M5–H17). Both workers routinely cross, double back, and leave object obstacles at critical waypoints including Area 2's perimeter, main aisle intersections, and Area 4's staging entry. The overlapping, batch-driven workflows mean the robot repeatedly encounters unpredictable human presence or equipment at nearly every path segment, forcing multiple prolonged halts as it only resumes once the environment clears. All delays arise from realistic, high-cadence human activity within operational necessity, resulting in the longest possible total time for the robot to reach its goal under the given route.",
