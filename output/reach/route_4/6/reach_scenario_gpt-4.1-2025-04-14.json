  "scenario": "During a mandatory mid-cycle warehouse audit and relabeling operation, Worker 1 systematically removes inventory from Shelves 1–6 (Region 2), carts it to Area 3 for verification, and regularly delivers partially or fully checked batches to Area 4 for relabeling and final staging. Simultaneously, Worker 2 pulls batches from Boxes 1–3 (Region 1), inspects them in Area 1, and also brings them for relabeling/secondary audit in Area 4, before returning completed inventory to Boxes 1–3 or Large Shelf 1. Both workers alternate, sometimes verify each other's work, frequently pause, stage, or double back with carts, bins, and totes at every key corridor funnel (M5, L6, K9, K11, K13, H16, H17) and within Area 4 itself (robot’s goal). Area 4 remains continuously congested due to parallel relabeling work, with frequent crossovers and shared resource access. The robot, traveling its fixed route (M5 to H17), repeatedly encounters unpredictable, sustained human occupancy and object blockages at every key segment and within its goal area, forcing repeated stops and extended waits based solely on environmental changes. All disruption arises from legitimate operational requirements, creating the longest possible total travel time for the robot to reach its goal.",
