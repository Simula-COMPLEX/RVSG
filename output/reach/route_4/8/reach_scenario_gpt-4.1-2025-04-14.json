  "scenario": "Amid an urgent outbound order consolidation and simultaneous safety remediation operation, Worker 1 assembles large, mixed-SKU customer shipments, repeatedly crossing the main warehouse spine to pick SKUs from Large Shelf 1, Shelves 2/3, and Boxes 2, using Area 3 and Area 4 for temporary staging and frequent repacking, which results in heavy, sometimes unmanned carts intermittently blocking primary navigation waypoints (M5–H17). Meanwhile, Worker 2, conducting a mandated dynamic hazard remediation sweep, systematically inspects main corridors and staging areas, removes misplaced materials, addresses spills, and deploys portable spill barriers or cones precisely along the crucial waypoints (K9, K11, K13, I15, H16) and at entrance points of Areas 2–4. This overlapping, unpredictable pattern of worker movement, double-backing, and legitimate corridor blockages due to tasks or temporary equipment causes nearly every segment of the robot’s fixed route to be repeatedly and variably obstructed, forcing the robot to stop and wait throughout its journey. With no direct human-robot interaction and all disruption caused by authentic, safety-driven and operationally essential workflows, the robot’s total travel time to its goal is maximized purely by the complex, real-world parallel activities of the human workers.",
