  "scenario": "A simultaneous surprise cycle count and urgent partial-pallet outbound fulfillment operation unfolds: Worker 1 conducts cycle counts and batch recounts on Large Shelf 1 and Large Shelf 3, repeatedly moving batches to Area 4 for verification and sometimes double-backing for recounts, pausing or staging totes at critical aisle waypoints (K9, K11, K13, H17) along the robot’s fixed path. Worker 2, fulfilling a sudden custom pallet order, must rapidly pick goods from Shelves 4–6 and Boxes 2–3, also staging and packing in Area 4, with repeated cross-warehouse trips and double-backs, sometimes occupying the same corridors and staging areas as Worker 1. Both workflows naturally require frequent, legitimate presence, pausing, and staging of materials at all spine waypoints and directly in the robot’s main aisle and at its goal (Area 4), with frequent recounts and repacking further intensifying congestion. The robot’s route from M5 to H17 is therefore routinely, unpredictably, and legitimately blocked by human workers and mobile equipment at nearly every step, causing the robot to stop and wait multiple times along its route, and maximizing the total time required to reach its goal entirely through authentic high-activity warehouse workflows.",
