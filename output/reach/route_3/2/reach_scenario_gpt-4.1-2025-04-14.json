  "scenario": "At the end of shift, simultaneous full-scope shelf auditing (Worker 1) and urgent mixed-item outbound order picking and assembly (Worker 2) are underway. Worker 1 audits and inspects all shelves in Region 2, removing, counting, and restaging boxes while repeatedly blocking the main corridor (E9–F10, F9–F10) with audit carts and temporary staging. Worker 2 picks outbound items from Boxes 2, Large Shelf 3, and Shelf 1–2, staging loads across the same corridor (E8–E9, F8–F9) for packing, then transferring to Area 1. Their overlapping, concurrent high-urgency workflows force both to use the same corridor for prolonged, unpredictable periods, creating dynamic, shifting congestion and temporary environmental obstructions exactly where the robot’s fixed route must pass from A9 to G4. The robot is forced to wait multiple times behind physical obstacles, experiencing the longest total time to reach its goal, as all delays stem solely from real, workflow-driven activities and environmental conditions, not from intentional interference or staged blocking.",
