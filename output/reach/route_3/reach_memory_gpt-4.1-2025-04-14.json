    "summary": "During a peak receiving and inspection period, two human workers are assigned overlapping tasks requiring both to frequently transport, stage, and sort large shipments between Large Shelf 1 and Area 1, as well as retrieve additional stock from Shelf 1 and dispose of waste items. Both workers repeatedly move heavy boxes and rolling carts through the narrow central corridor (E–G, Columns 4–9)—the fixed route of the autonomous robot (from A9 to G4). Their legitimate, workflow-driven actions involve frequent, unavoidable pausing, cross-traffic, and interim object placement directly on or near the robot’s path while staging, inspecting, or sorting items. At times, both workers occupy the corridor simultaneously or block adjacent waypoints, forcing the robot to stop, wait, and resume only after the path is cleared. As a result, the robot experiences maximum cumulative environmental delays, causing it to take the longest possible time to reach its goal, with all disruptions stemming from authentic bulk handling and high-activity process flows.",

Their overlapping, high-frequency activities focus on the same Shelf 1–Area 1/2 corridor, with both often occupying, staging, or transiting through critical waypoints (E9, F9, F8, F7, G4–G7).
