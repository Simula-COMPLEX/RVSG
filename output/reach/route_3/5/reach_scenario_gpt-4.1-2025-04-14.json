  "scenario": "During a simultaneous emergency stock evacuation and live quality triage operation triggered by suspected product damage, Worker 1 cycles between Boxes 1 & 3 (Region 1) and Large Shelf 3 & 4 (Region 4), evacuating items to Area 3 for inspection and restaging salvageable stock in Area 2, while Worker 2 triages urgent inventory from Large Shelf 2 and Shelf 2/3 to Area 1 for processing, then moves sorted stock to Area 4/5 or aggregates waste. Both must frequently cross and temporarily stage boxes, trolleys, or carts at main corridor waypoints (particularly E7, F7, G7, and G4), with their rapid, high-volume movements and pauses causing unpredictable, overlapping obstructions directly in the robot's fixed navigation route (A9 to G4). The result is repeated, workflow-driven delays as the robot must stop or wait for path clearance at multiple points, maximizing total travel time entirely through legitimate high-urgency process congestion, not intentional interference or communication.",
