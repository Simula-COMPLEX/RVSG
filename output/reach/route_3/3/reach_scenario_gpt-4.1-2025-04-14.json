  "scenario": "In the midst of a high-urgency, mixed cross-docking and audit operation, Worker 1 repeatedly transfers bulk shipments from Boxes 2 (Region 1) to Area 5 (dispatch staging, Region 3), then retrieves a pallet jack to transport and load goods toward Large Shelf 4 before returning, all via the main corridor (E4–G4, E9–G22). Worker 2 concurrently conducts cycle counting and sorting between Shelf 1, Boxes 3, and Areas 1 & 2, frequently moving and staging items for inspection, correction, or disposal between Shelving, Boxes, Waste Area, and Areas 1/2. Both workers frequently occupy, block, or stage objects at critical corridor waypoints (especially E9–E4, F9–F4, G4), causing unpredictable, repeated obstructions to the autonomous robot's fixed route (A9 to G4). The robot must frequently stop or wait, forced by legitimate process-driven environmental disruptions, leading to the maximum possible total time to reach its goal. All workflow and delays arise organically from core receiving, audit, staging, and dispatch operations, making the scenario both realistic and maximally disruptive to autonomous navigation.",
