  "scenario": "During a high-volume post-promotion returns processing and random quality audit period, two human workers independently operate high-frequency, high-volume tasks that overlap across all central warehouse regions. Worker 1 retrieves bulk return shipments from Boxes 2 and 3, stages items for inspection in Area 2, then sorts accepted products onto Shelf 1 and delivers rejects to the Waste Area, repeatedly passing through and often pausing in the central corridor (E9–F9–G9, F8–F7–G4). Worker 2 conducts random spot audits, fetching items from Shelf 1, Large Shelf 2, and Boxes 3, staging and inspecting them in Area 1, but also supporting return overflow and performing secondary transfers to Area 2 or Waste, leading to unpredictable bidirectional movement and frequent staging directly in the robot’s fixed route (E9–G4 corridor). Due to high volumes and limited staging space, both workers independently but repeatedly pause, restage, or temporarily block central waypoints with carts and pallets, particularly at F9, F8, G8, and G4. This organic, high-density, and asynchronous overlap causes the autonomous robot’s progress from A9 to G4 to be maximally delayed, as it must frequently stop and wait for unpredictable, workflow-driven physical obstructions to clear, resulting in the longest possible time to reach its goal without any direct communication or intentional interference.",
