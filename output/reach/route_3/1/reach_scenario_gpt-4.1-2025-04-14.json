  "scenario": "During a critical concurrent inventory turnover and replenishment operation, Worker 1 repeatedly moves bulk cases from Large Shelf 2 to Area 2 (using it as a temporary staging zone), and then stocks Shelf 1 whenever slots open, often pausing in the main corridor with pallets or carts. Simultaneously, Worker 2 continuously cycles inventory between Shelf 1 and Area 1 for live cycle count and inspection, transporting cartons back and forth and sometimes using Boxes 2 for temporary overstock. Their overlapping, high-frequency activities focus on the same Shelf 1–Area 1/2 corridor, with both often occupying, staging, or transiting through critical waypoints (E9, F9, F8, F7, G4–G7). This real-world workflow causes unpredictable and frequent indirect obstructions in the robot’s fixed path from A9 to G4, maximizing cumulative delays as the robot must stop or wait repeatedly at multiple points, ultimately resulting in the slowest completion time for its route. All disruptions arise from legitimate, high-urgency operational flows and continuous inventory movement, not from intentional interference or contrived positioning.",
