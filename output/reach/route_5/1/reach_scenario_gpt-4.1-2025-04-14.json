  "scenario": "During a simultaneous quarterly inventory audit and emergency product recall, Worker 1 conducts sequential item recounts across all Large Shelves, moving misplaced or surplus items to Area 1 or 2, while Worker 2 retrieves recalled items from Shelves, Boxes, and Areas 1/2, transporting them to Area 5 for sorting and then to the Waste Area. Both use the G-row corridor intensively: Worker 1 repeatedly crosses the main aisle to stage or collect items, often pausing mid-corridor to annotate or sort, while Worker 2 regularly moves bulky retrieved goods between Area 5 and the Waste Area, placing trolleys and objects along the route. High activity and frequent unsynchronized crossovers create persistent, unpredictable obstructions as both workers temporarily block or occupy the fixed robot pathway at multiple points. The robot, navigating autonomously from G19 to G3, is forced to stop or slow repeatedly due to worker presence and ad hoc item placement, resulting in maximally extended total travel time, all arising from legitimate, operationally necessary warehouse activities without intentional interference.",
