  "scenario": "During peak inbound and outbound operations, Worker 1 and Worker 2 both frequently travel back and forth along the G-row corridor between Area 5 (G19) and the Waste Area (G3), as well as Areas 1–2, for sorting, inspection, staging, and disposal tasks. Worker 1 receives and inspects new stock in Area 5, then moves between Area 5, Areas 1–2, and the Waste Area, while Worker 2 clears Areas 1–2, transfers items to large shelves, and also transports defective goods to the Waste Area. Their workflows overlap extensively, often causing both workers (and their carts or pallets) to pause, maneuver, or temporarily block the G-row corridor at unpredictable intervals. As the robot follows its fixed path from G19 to G3, it is repeatedly forced to stop, wait, or slow down because its route coincides with the busiest shared operational corridor, resulting in the longest possible total time for the robot to complete its route due to frequent worker-caused obstructions.",
