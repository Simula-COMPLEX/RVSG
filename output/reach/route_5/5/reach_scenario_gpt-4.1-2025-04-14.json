  "scenario": "During a full-system workflow validation and stress-testing operation, Worker 1 is assigned to move returned or older stock from Large Shelves 2 and 3 to Area 2 for compliance check, sort items for reintegration into central Shelves or disposal, and shuttle all waste leftward to the Waste Area, often staging bins along the G-row corridor. In parallel, Worker 2 rapidly cycles between bulk pick (Boxes 1/2), central Shelves, and dispatch staging (Area 5), assembling mixed orders, pausing to sort, label, or replenish, and repeatedly crossing the G-row corridor and staging containers at corridor intersections. Both workers frequently double-back, pause for checks, and stage bins or trolleys in the central aisle, resulting in constant, unpredictable, and extended blockages at nearly every segment of the robot's fixed G19→G3 path. The combined effect of dense, overlapping, and unsynchronized traffic—plus frequent temporary static obstacles—forces the robot to slow, stop, or detour repeatedly, thus taking the longest possible total time to reach its waste-dumping goal, with all process delays emerging naturally from the operational demands of simultaneous high-frequency pick, return, compliance, and dispatch flows.",
