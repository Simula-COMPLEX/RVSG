  "scenario": "An urgent hazardous materials misclassification crisis triggers a warehouse-wide emergency recertification sweep. Worker 1 (Recertification Specialist) shuttles potentially noncompliant items from all Large Shelves and Area 5 to staging zones in Areas 3 and 4 for detailed compliance checks, unpacking and sorting each box on-site. Worker 2 (Hazardous Materials Handler) synchronously collects identified hazardous items from the inspection zones, transporting them to the Waste Area or, if further review is needed, back to Area 5 or Boxes 2–3. Both workers repeatedly cycle through and pause in the critical G-row corridor, staging items, repositioning trolleys, and conducting task hand-offs in tight spaces. Their overlapping, highly dynamic inspection and waste transport workflows—combined with frequent, legitimate stoppages, repackaging, and mutual zone congestion—create near-continuous, unpredictable obstructions directly along the robot’s fixed route (G19→G3). The robot, which can only react to environmental changes and must navigate around static or moving blockages, experiences the maximum possible delays, stopping or slowing at every segment due to legitimate workflow congestion as both workers perform high-frequency, compliance-driven item handoffs, repackaging, and transport in and out of Areas 3, 4, 5, Waste, and adjacent corridors.",
