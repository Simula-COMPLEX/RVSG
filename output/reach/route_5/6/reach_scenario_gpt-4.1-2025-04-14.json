  "scenario": "During a simultaneous urgent cross-docking operation and a facility-wide defective goods quarantine audit, Worker 1 rapidly shuttles inbound stock from Boxes 1–3 and Large Shelf 1 to Area 1 for immediate sorting, then splits outgoing product to central Shelves 3/5 and recalls rejected goods back to staging. At the same time, Worker 2 audits all outgoing and staging items for defects, transporting suspected goods from Area 5, Shelves 2/4, and staging zones to the Waste Area, frequently consolidating or pausing in Areas 3 and 4 for inspection and quarantine. Both workers make repeated use of trolleys and carts, often staging them or pausing to document, sort, or inspect directly within the G-row corridor (G19–G3), which is also the robot’s only route. The unpredictable, persistent mix of cross-traffic, multi-area crossings, ad hoc object placement, and overlapping tasks creates dynamic, near-constant obstructions along the entire robot route. As a result, the robot must stop, wait, or frequently slow at almost every segment of its fixed path to the Waste Area, yielding the maximum possible completion time, with all delays arising from the legitimate, high-frequency, and unsynchronized operational activities of both workers.",
