  "scenario": "During an end-of-quarter bulk consolidation and process redesign pilot, Worker 1 is tasked with collecting and moving overflow pallets from Large Shelf 1 and Large Shelf 4 into Areas 1, 2, and 5 for staging and audit, frequently transporting and unloading large loads directly along the main G-row corridor (G19–G3). Worker 2 leads an on-the-fly sortation pilot, circulating throughout Areas 1, 2, and 5 to inspect, sort, and relay goods for further storage, redeployment, or waste, repeatedly transferring bins and staging containers along the same G-row path before moving sorted waste to the Waste Area (G3). Both workers’ high-frequency, large-object movements, ad hoc corridor staging, and overlapping, interdependent workflows cause persistent, multi-point, and sometimes simultaneous obstructions across the robot’s entire fixed path from G19 to G3. The robot must constantly stop, wait, or detour due to these legitimate, operationally driven blockages—extending its total travel time to the maximum possible, all without any direct communication or intentional interference.",
