  "scenario": "During an unscheduled, high-pressure product recall operation, Worker 1 (Returns Processor) continually shuttles recalled goods from Large Shelf 4 to Area 5 for inspection, then sorts items into Area 2 for possible restocking or takes irreparable stock to the Waste Area. Simultaneously, Worker 2 (Ad Hoc Restocker & Auditor) rapidly cycles between Shelves 1–6, Large Shelf 2, and Areas 1–2 to pull substitute goods for outbound orders, reloads valid returns from Area 2, and removes damaged items for disposal, all while staging and handling bulk loads via carts and bins. Their workflows overlap extensively: both workers frequently pause or stage bins, carts, and return loads directly along the main G-row corridor (waypoints G19–G3), often leaving objects in the aisle as they perform time-consuming checks, documentation, or recategorization. The robot, which must travel along G19 to G3, is repeatedly obstructed by both workers’ legitimate, time-intensive staging and processing activities at every critical point of its path, forcing it to stop, wait, or take detours throughout its entire route. There is no direct human-robot communication—delays arise solely from real operational overlap and workspace congestion, resulting in the maximally extended total time for the robot to reach its goal.",
