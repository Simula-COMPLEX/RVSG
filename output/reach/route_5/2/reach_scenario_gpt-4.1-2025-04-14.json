  "scenario": "During a simultaneous warehouse capacity rebalancing and urgent dispatch event, Worker 1 continuously moves pallets and overflow inventory from Boxes 3 and Large Shelf 2 into Areas 1 and 2, frequently pausing with pallets or partially unloading in the G-row corridor (columns 6–15) for restaging and documentation. Meanwhile, Worker 2 picks urgent items from Shelves 5–6, Boxes 1, and Large Shelf 3, shuttling trolleys loaded with dispatch parcels from G19 leftward to Areas 5 and 4, making frequent mid-corridor stops to prepare packages, attach labels, and gather packing materials. Both workers commonly use or block the central G-row simultaneously and independently, often leaving trolleys and pallets in the aisle or pausing at key waypoints, creating dynamic, unpredictable, and multi-point obstructions along nearly the entire fixed robot route. The robot, traveling from G19 to G3, is forced to repeatedly stop or slow for long periods wherever worker activity or temporary blockages occur, maximizing its total time to complete the route. This scenario’s persistent, overlapping, independent high-priority workflows naturally generate the highest possible indirect disruption to the robot’s path due to dense, shifting worker presence and corridor congestion.",
