  "scenario": "During a mandatory 'Quality Blitz Day,' Worker 1 (Quality Inspector) and Worker 2 (Material Handler & Waste Segregator) operate interleaved, high-overlap cycles involving frequent item inspections, staging, and mass disposal. Worker 1 inspects items in Area 5, shuttles suspect goods to Area 2 for recheck, and moves confirmed waste to the Waste Area, repeatedly traveling left and right along the G-row corridor, often pausing with carts adjacent to the robot’s route. Worker 2 hauls new stock from Large Shelf 4 to Area 5 and simultaneously ferries waste bins from the Waste Area to Large Shelf 1, frequently crossing and blocking waypoints along the G-row (G19–G3) as he pauses to reorganize loads or coordinate with Worker 1. Their activities, including staging, re-sorting, and bin handling, lead to repeated, unpredictable physical blockages along every major waypoint of the robot's fixed pathway, requiring the robot to stop, wait, or slow at multiple stages, and producing the slowest-possible completion time for the robot’s task—all due to legitimate, unsynchronized human workflows and not intentional disruption.",
