Worker 1 receives and inspects new stock in Area 5, then moves between Area 5, Areas 1–2, and the Waste Area, while Worker 2 clears Areas 1–2, transfers items to large shelves, and also transports defective goods to the Waste Area. Their workflows overlap extensively, often causing both workers (and their carts or pallets) to pause, maneuver, or temporarily block the G-row corridor at unpredictable intervals. As the robot follows its fixed path from G19 to G3, it is repeatedly forced to stop, wait, or slow down because its route coincides with the busiest shared operational corridor, resulting in the longest possible total time for the robot to complete its route due to frequent worker-caused obstructions.",

Both use the G-row corridor intensively: Worker 1 repeatedly crosses the main aisle to stage or collect items, often pausing mid-corridor to annotate or sort, while Worker 2 regularly moves bulky retrieved goods between Area 5 and the Waste Area, placing trolleys and objects along the route.

Meanwhile, Worker 2 picks urgent items from Shelves 5–6, Boxes 1, and Large Shelf 3, shuttling trolleys loaded with dispatch parcels from G19 leftward to Areas 5 and 4, making frequent mid-corridor stops to prepare packages, attach labels, and gather packing materials. Both workers commonly use or block the central G-row simultaneously and independently, often leaving trolleys and pallets in the aisle or pausing at key waypoints, creating dynamic, unpredictable, and multi-point obstructions along nearly the entire fixed robot route.

Their activities, including staging, re-sorting, and bin handling, lead to repeated, unpredictable physical blockages along every major waypoint of the robot's fixed pathway, requiring the robot to stop, wait, or slow at multiple stages, and producing the slowest-possible completion time for the robot’s task—all due to legitimate, unsynchronized human workflows and not intentional disruption.",

Worker 2 (Hazardous Materials Handler) synchronously collects identified hazardous items from the inspection zones, transporting them to the Waste Area or, if further review is needed, back to Area 5 or Boxes 2–3. Both workers repeatedly cycle through and pause in the critical G-row corridor, staging items, repositioning trolleys, and conducting task hand-offs in tight spaces. Their overlapping, highly dynamic inspection and waste transport workflows—combined with frequent, legitimate stoppages, repackaging, and mutual zone congestion—create near-continuous, unpredictable obstructions directly along the robot’s fixed route (G19→G3). The robot, which can only react to environmental changes and must navigate around static or moving blockages, experiences the maximum possible delays, stopping or slowing at every segment due to legitimate workflow congestion as both workers perform high-frequency, compliance-driven item handoffs, repackaging, and transport in and out of Areas 3, 4, 5, Waste, and adjacent corridors.",

In parallel, Worker 2 rapidly cycles between bulk pick (Boxes 1/2), central Shelves, and dispatch staging (Area 5), assembling mixed orders, pausing to sort, label, or replenish, and repeatedly crossing the G-row corridor and staging containers at corridor intersections. Both workers frequently double-back, pause for checks, and stage bins or trolleys in the central aisle, resulting in constant, unpredictable, and extended blockages at nearly every segment of the robot's fixed G19→G3 path. The combined effect of dense, overlapping, and unsynchronized traffic—plus frequent temporary static obstacles—forces the robot to slow, stop, or detour repeatedly, thus taking the longest possible total time to reach its waste-dumping goal, with all process delays emerging naturally from the operational demands of simultaneous high-frequency pick, return, compliance, and dispatch flows.",
