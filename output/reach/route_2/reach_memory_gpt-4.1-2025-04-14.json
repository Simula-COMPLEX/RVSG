    "summary": "During a busy receiving and restocking shift, two human workers perform overlapping workflows—both collecting new deliveries from Region 1, sorting and inspecting them in Region 3 (Areas 1–2), and alternately transporting restocked items to both Large Shelf 4 (robot start) and Shelf 2/3 (robot destination). Both workers use hand trucks and carts, repeatedly moving along the main corridor pathways and through operational zones directly traversed by the robot’s fixed route (M21 to E14). The high activity, repeated parallel movement, frequent temporary object placement, and alternating restocking tasks mean that the robot must repeatedly stop or slow down to avoid workers and obstructions, leading to the longest possible total time for the robot to complete its path, solely due to legitimate workflow-driven congestion and shared spatial usage.",
