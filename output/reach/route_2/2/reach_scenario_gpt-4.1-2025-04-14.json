  "scenario": "During a quarterly stock rotation and hazardous material disposal cycle, two workers simultaneously conduct overlapping and complementary operations that heavily disrupt the robot's fixed route from M21 to E14. Worker 1 repeatedly removes old stock from both Large Shelf 4 and Shelves 2/3, staging and rearranging items at Area 4 in Region 3 before restorage, while Worker 2 searches for expired or hazardous items across various shelves, inspects and sorts them in Area 4, and periodically transfers flagged waste to the Waste Area. Both workers independently and frequently traverse the central corridor (F15–H16), using trolleys and rolling carts that are often temporarily parked or left within the main path, unintentionally blocking the robot’s way. Their unsynchronized movement, repeated pausing for inspection and sorting, and constant staging/re-staging of goods lead to frequent, varied, and unpredictable obstructions directly on the robot’s navigation grid. With no direct communication, the robot must stop and wait for environmental changes at multiple chokepoints, causing a maximum cumulative delay and resulting in the longest possible time to reach its goal solely due to realistic, legitimate workflow congestion.",
