  "scenario": "During a high-complexity serialized part traceability audit coinciding with a multi-stage component consolidation for outbound manufacturing, two human workers operate in overlapping, high-density workflows that maximize environmental disruption along the robot’s fixed M21-to-E14 navigation route. Worker 1—the Compliance Auditor—sequences physical inspection and scanning of serialized items across all Large Shelves (M21–M9), several Shelves (E10–E21), and Boxes (B5–B9), repeatedly pausing or leaving audit tools and item stacks in central corridors and operational zones (F14, F15, K18, L20, E14, J17), especially while verifying item serials or cross-checking paperwork in Areas 2/4. Worker 2—the Component Consolidation Specialist—cycles between Boxes 1–3, Shelves 1–4, and Large Shelves 2/4, shuttling and merging kit components through Areas 1, 2, and 5, frequently consolidating or staging bins in corridor pinch points (F14, F15, K18, L20, J17) whenever operational zones fill. Their workflows overlap often and dynamically, with both pausing for documentation, item checks, or temporary storage within the main corridors, leading to prolonged, unpredictable blockages at nearly every segment of the robot’s path. As both perform legitimate, high-complexity operational tasks—without any awareness or intentional disruption of the robot—the resulting persistent congestion and shifting physical obstructions force the robot to stop, wait, or slowly advance multiple times, making this scenario the slowest possible execution for the robot to reach its goal, purely as a byproduct of authentic warehouse workflow complexity.",
