  "scenario": "During an end-of-month surge combining reverse logistics and bulk restocking, Worker 1 (Returns Coordinator) processes and repackages returned items, moving in complex, multi-stage flows between Area 1, Area 2, Area 4, and Boxes 3, repeatedly staging a mobile worktable or rolling bin at corridor pinch points (G15, J17, F14, F15). Concurrently, Worker 2 (Restocking Specialist) continuously transports high-demand stock from Large Shelf 4 and Boxes 1 to Shelf 2 and Shelf 3, frequently pausing for inventory checks or using a pallet jack at tight corridor locations (L20, K18, F15, E14). Their overlapping, asynchronous movement, multi-point mid-task equipment pauses, and frequent, unpredictable temporary staging of goods and tools along the central navigation corridor create complex, shifting blockages along nearly every segment of the robot’s fixed M21-to-E14 route. With no direct worker-robot interaction or intentional disruption, the robot must repeatedly stop and wait until environmental obstructions are cleared, leading to the longest possible time to reach its goal due solely to highly realistic, legitimate workflow congestion and concurrent operational demands.",
