  "scenario": "During a peak-period audit-driven kitting and damage verification workflow, Worker 1 repeatedly retrieves bulk items from Large Shelf 4 and Large Shelf 2, assembling outbound kits in Area 3 before picking additional components from Shelf 3 and pausing for inspection there. Worker 2 simultaneously conducts shelf inventory verification starting at Shelf 2, shuttling damaged goods to the Waste Area via the main corridor and returning to re-inspect or restock at Area 3 and Shelf 3. Both workers’ tasks require frequent crisscrossing and pausing with carts and item totes at corridor pinch points such as F15, E14, G15, and H16. Their independently driven workflows lead to continual, unpredictable blocking of the robot’s primary navigation path (M21 to E14), as both their presence and temporary object placements force the robot to stop, wait, or re-approach multiple times. With no communication or awareness of the robot, these legitimate operational behaviors cumulatively produce the maximum possible route delay, resulting in the slowest possible robot transit time purely through workflow-driven congestion.",
