  "scenario": "During a scheduled weekly cycle count coinciding with the afternoon returns peak, two human workers independently and simultaneously conduct cross-functional workflows that heavily intersect the robot's fixed path from M21 to E14. Worker 1 processes and sorts incoming returns, repeatedly moving between Boxes 2, multiple sorting areas (Area 2, 3, 4), and both Shelf 3 (E16) and Large Shelf 4 (M21), pushing carts and pallets along the main corridor. Worker 2 conducts randomized cycle counts, moving a mobile scanning ladder between Large Shelf zones, Shelf 2/3, and operational Areas 4/5, often pausing for audits at E14–E16 and F14–F16—sometimes parking equipment in the corridor itself. Both workers' overlapping, unsynchronized activities and frequent equipment use naturally create prolonged and unpredictable physical blockages at various points along the robot’s route, forcing it into repeated stops, slow advances, and waits. These legitimate, workflow-driven obstructions induce the maximum possible cumulative delay on the robot’s progress, extending its total time to reach its goal solely through realistic operational congestion.",
