  "scenario": "During a dual-stage warehouse audit and high-priority kitting operation coinciding with a returns surge, Worker 1 alternates between cross-zone inventory auditing (cycling between Large Shelf 4 and all Small Shelves, displacing goods into Areas 4/5) and returns processing (retrieving returns from Area 1, inspecting in Area 2, and restaging or reshelving items to Large Shelf 4 and Shelf 3), often leaving mobile scan stations or item carts at corridor pinch points along the robot’s route. Worker 2 assembles and finalizes VIP outbound kits by sequentially collecting components from both Large Shelf 4 and multiple Small Shelves, passing through and pausing in Areas 3–5 for assembly, inspection, and dispatch staging, and frequently using the pallet jack at G–H22 to transport large orders, with in-aisle staging or loading at bottlenecks (E14, F14, F15). Both workers’ interleaving, equipment-laden operations require repeated, unpredictable deployment, movement, and pausing on nearly every segment of the core corridor the robot uses, with mobile equipment and temporarily staged goods causing intermittent yet nearly constant legitimate blockages. This persistent, workflow-driven congestion maximizes total environmental delay, causing the robot to take the longest possible time to reach its E14 destination with no direct human-robot interaction, purely due to legitimate, complex operational disruption.",
