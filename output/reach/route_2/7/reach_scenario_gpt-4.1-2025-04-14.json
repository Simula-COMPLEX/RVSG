  "scenario": "During an emergency cross-docking and double quarantine operation following a suspected supplier contamination event, two human workers engage in highly interdependent, urgent workflows that create maximum environmental disruption along the robot’s fixed route from Large Shelf 4 (M21) to Shelf 2/3 (E14). Worker 1 continuously offloads inbound goods at Boxes 3, stages them in Area 5 for visual quarantine, and shuttles cleared items via Area 2 to Large Shelf 4, often leaving loaded carts along the lower corridor and temporarily parking overflow in navigation chokepoints when operational zones fill. Simultaneously, Worker 2 immediately transfers these items from Large Shelf 4 to Shelf 2/3 for rapid secondary inspection; cleared items are sometimes cycled back to Large Shelf 4 or moved to Area 4 if flagged, before potentially being taken to the Waste Area. Both workers frequently stage rolling equipment or goods at critical waypoints—especially at the robot’s entry (M21–L21), mid-corridor pinch points (K18–K17, F15–F14), and corridor endpoint (E14)—resulting in frequent, unpredictable, and prolonged legitimate blockages. Their overlapping, unscheduled activity cycles, repeated physical exchanges, and overflow-driven de-staging create the highest possible cumulative delay for the robot, as it must constantly stop and wait for its path to clear before proceeding, resulting in the slowest total time to complete its route. No direct communication or intentional interference occurs; all delays are the natural result of urgent, legally required, and operationally essential workflow interactions.",
