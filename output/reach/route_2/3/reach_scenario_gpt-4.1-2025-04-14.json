  "scenario": "During an annual safety audit and deep cleaning event coinciding with a major outbound order staging rush, Worker 1 repeatedly moves audit equipment, hazard signage, and cleaning carts between all Large Shelves (Region 4) and Shelves 2/3 (Region 2), pausing for extended audits and cleaning at chokepoints K18, K17, F15, and E14—often leaving cleaning equipment or blocking corridors for several minutes per stop. Simultaneously, Worker 2 cycles stock between Large Shelf 4, Shelves 2/3, and operational Areas 3–5, staging outbound orders, correcting errors, and pausing with loaded carts and unmatched pallets at G15, F15, F14, and E14 during labeling and inventory reconciliation. Their high-urgency, legitimate workflows repeatedly cause overlapping stationary and moving blockages at the core of the robot's navigation grid, compounding frequent and unpredictable obstructions across the entire route from M21 to E14. The robot, operating purely by environmental awareness, must repeatedly stop, wait, and re-assess its path, resulting in maximized cumulative delay—its slowest possible time—due to authentic, high-traffic operational disruption and extensive shared corridor use.",
