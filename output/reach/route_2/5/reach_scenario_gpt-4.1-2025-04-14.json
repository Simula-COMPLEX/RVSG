  "scenario": "During an urgent batch quality recall coinciding with manual inventory reconciliation, Worker 1 repeatedly isolates at-risk items from both Large Shelf 4 (M21, robot start) and Shelf 2 (E14, robot goal), transferring them in multiple trips to Area 5 (J21), with each trip involving prolonged mid-corridor scanning, checks, and temporary staging that blocks key waypoints along the robot’s path. Simultaneously, Worker 2 repeatedly shuttles misallocated or unlabelled stock between Large Shelf 3 (M17), Shelf 3 (E16), Area 4 (J17), and Area 5 (J21), reconciling inventory and often pausing with carts or item stacks at corridor pinch points (F15, F14, G15, J17) that overlap the robot’s fixed navigation grid (M21 to E14). The repeatedly overlapping, urgent, unsynchronized workflows create unpredictable, high-frequency obstructions at multiple segments of the robot’s route, forcing the robot to execute repeated stops, waits, and slow progress, thereby producing the longest possible total time for it to reach its goal—purely as a consequence of authentic, high-stress operational congestion and shared spatial resource use.",
