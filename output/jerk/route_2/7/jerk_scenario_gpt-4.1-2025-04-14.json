  "scenario": "An unexpected emergency event (e.g., leakage or spill) occurs near Large Shelf 4, requiring immediate salvage and redistribution of vulnerable inventory. Worker 1 is responsible for relocating and sorting threatened goods from Large Shelf 4, using Area 5 and Area 4 for inspection and temporarily staging overflow materials, often having to place pallets or bins directly in main corridor waypoints (K18, J17, H16, and F15) when operational zones are at capacity. Waste is moved to the Waste Area only after triage. Worker 2 concurrently performs emergency redistribution of critical SKUs from Large Shelves 3/4 and Shelf 3, shuttling them to safe storage zones (Shelf 2, Shelf 1, Area 2/3), and frequently stages or pauses with pallets in critical robot path nodes (F15, H15, E14) when encountering congestion or waiting for space. Both workers’ urgent, real-time crisis response repeatedly forces them—and temporarily placed objects—into overlapping use of the robot’s fixed path from M21 to E14, unpredictably blocking or constricting waypoints as they triage, handoff, and transfer loads. The robot, responding autonomously to changes in the physical environment, must frequently slow, stop, and accelerate when the path clears, resulting in higher average jerk. All disruptions result from legitimate emergency workflows, not intentional obstruction or direct interaction.",
