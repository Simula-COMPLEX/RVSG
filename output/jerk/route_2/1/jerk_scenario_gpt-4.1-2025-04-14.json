  "scenario": "During a combined inventory audit and unscheduled returns processing event, two human workers independently and repeatedly circulate between Large Shelf 4, Shelf 2, Shelf 3, and central staging/inspection zones (Area 2 and Area 3). Worker 1 audits stock and sorts inbound returns, frequently moving items between Large Shelf 4 and Shelf 2 while pausing to document discrepancies. Worker 2 reintegrates inspected returns into storage and performs spot checks, often reversing direction to resolve mismatches. Both workers alternate and overlap spatially, frequently pausing or temporarily staging items at the ends of shelves or in the central aisle near the robot’s fixed route (M21 to E14). This creates unpredictable, recurring obstructions along the robot’s pathway, forcing it into repeated abrupt stops, starts, and detours that induce a higher average jerk in its trajectory due solely to real-world workflow congestion and spatial crossover, with no direct coordination or deliberate interference.",
