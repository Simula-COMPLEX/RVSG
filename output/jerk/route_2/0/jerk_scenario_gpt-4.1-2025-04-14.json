  "scenario": "During a high-throughput warehouse operation, two human workers are responsible for receiving, sorting, inspection, urgent shelf replenishment, and waste handling. Worker 1 receives and inspects inbound goods, moving items from Large Shelf 4 to inspection/sorting areas in Region 3 and then to Shelves 2 and 3, following a route that overlaps the robot’s fixed path (M21 to E14) via key central corridors. Worker 2 handles dynamic order picking, dispatch, periodic replenishment to Shelves 2/3, and frequently carries waste to the Waste Area, also using the same main pathways. Both workers independently and often concurrently travel through and operate in the same aisles as the robot, temporarily placing objects and physically occupying critical waypoints. Their overlapping, unsynchronized tasks repeatedly put them and objects along the robot’s trajectory, causing the robot to frequently decelerate, stop, and rapidly resume travel, resulting in a higher average jerk due to repeated and unpredictable environmental obstructions. All workflow disruption to the robot arises solely from valid warehouse activities, not intentional interference.",
