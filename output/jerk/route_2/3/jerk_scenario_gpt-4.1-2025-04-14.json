  "scenario": "During a combined end-of-quarter cycle count and quality audit, two human workers perform overlapping but distinct operational tasks that create sustained, unpredictable congestion along the robot’s fixed route (M21 to E14). Worker 1 repeatedly moves large batches of items from Large Shelf 4 to Areas 4-5 for cycle counting and replenishment, using the main central corridor for transport and staging items in the aisle when shelf or area space is constrained. Worker 2 independently selects random items from Shelf 3, Shelf 5, Boxes 2, and Area 2 for on-the-spot or central audit, often returning or staging audit samples—and exception 'hold' boxes—at the closest available corridor point, frequently directly on the robot’s path. The random, high-frequency, and sometimes concurrent occupation or obstruction of shared corridor nodes (especially J17–H15) by workers or staged materials causes the robot to decelerate, stop, or resume motion abruptly in response to environmental changes, resulting in a notably higher average jerk. All disruptions to the robot emerge solely from the genuine, process-driven requirements of multi-zone counting and in-line audits compounded by ad hoc staging—without direct human-robot interaction or coordination.",
