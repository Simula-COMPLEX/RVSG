Worker 1 receives and inspects inbound goods, moving items from Large Shelf 4 to inspection/sorting areas in Region 3 and then to Shelves 2 and 3, following a route that overlaps the robot’s fixed path (M21 to E14) via key central corridors. Worker 2 handles dynamic order picking, dispatch, periodic replenishment to Shelves 2/3, and frequently carries waste to the Waste Area, also using the same main pathways. Both workers independently and often concurrently travel through and operate in the same aisles as the robot, temporarily placing objects and physically occupying critical waypoints. Their overlapping, unsynchronized tasks repeatedly put them and objects along the robot’s trajectory, causing the robot to frequently decelerate, stop, and rapidly resume travel, resulting in a higher average jerk due to repeated and unpredictable environmental obstructions.

Worker 1 manages variable-volume returns processing, using the pallet jack to transfer inspected items from Area 5 to Boxes 2/3, Shelf 2, or Waste Area, often staging carts and returns bins at central corridor intersections (notably J17, H16, F15) due to limited sorting space. Worker 2 responds to inventory system prompts to consolidate scattered low-stock SKUs, dynamically collecting and counting items from Boxes 3, Shelf 3, and Large Shelf 4, with interim staging and re-labeling in operational zones or directly in aisle waypoints (I17, F15, or E14), especially during temporary congestion. The highly variable, unscheduled, and spatially overlapping nature of their tasks—driven by returns surges, consolidation feedback, and ad-hoc staging—means the central corridor and key waypoints are frequently, unexpectedly blocked by humans and/or objects. The autonomous robot, lacking any direct communication and responding only to real-time physical obstructions, must repeatedly decelerate, stop, and accelerate abruptly as its path is disrupted.
