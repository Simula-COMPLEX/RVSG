  "scenario": "During a facility-wide reverse logistics surge and simultaneous urgent inventory consolidation, two human workers carry out overlapping, event-driven workflows that result in unpredictable, frequent obstructions along the robot’s fixed route from M21 to E14. Worker 1 manages variable-volume returns processing, using the pallet jack to transfer inspected items from Area 5 to Boxes 2/3, Shelf 2, or Waste Area, often staging carts and returns bins at central corridor intersections (notably J17, H16, F15) due to limited sorting space. Worker 2 responds to inventory system prompts to consolidate scattered low-stock SKUs, dynamically collecting and counting items from Boxes 3, Shelf 3, and Large Shelf 4, with interim staging and re-labeling in operational zones or directly in aisle waypoints (I17, F15, or E14), especially during temporary congestion. The highly variable, unscheduled, and spatially overlapping nature of their tasks—driven by returns surges, consolidation feedback, and ad-hoc staging—means the central corridor and key waypoints are frequently, unexpectedly blocked by humans and/or objects. The autonomous robot, lacking any direct communication and responding only to real-time physical obstructions, must repeatedly decelerate, stop, and accelerate abruptly as its path is disrupted. All interference is a byproduct of legitimate, high-intensity workflow demands, resulting in a high average jerk along the robot’s trajectory due to constantly changing environmental conditions in the shared workspace.",
