  "scenario": "During a split-shift restocking and exception handling surge, two human workers undertake dense, independently-paced workflows that repeatedly and unpredictably interfere with the robot's fixed route (M21 to E14). Worker 1 performs rapid-cycle replenishment, transferring fast-moving items from Large Shelf 2 and Boxes 3 to Shelves 2 and 3, with frequent diversions to transport mis-picked or damaged goods from dispatch staging (Area 5) back to storage or the Waste Area. Worker 2 manages multi-stage sorting and audit workflows, moving inbound items between Areas 2, 3, and 4, handling pallet jack operations and constantly restaging large or bulky loads for secondary inspection or late dispatch. Both workers traverse and temporarily block the main corridors the robot must use, especially at E14, J17, and H15, often staging objects, the pallet jack, and themselves unpredictably in the robot’s path due to operational necessity and crowding in staging areas. The combination of simultaneous, overlapping movement, recurrent mid-corridor sorting, and random placement/removal of goods and equipment—driven solely by legitimate workflow volume and spatial constraints—forces the robot to decelerate, halt, and resume motion abruptly in reaction to frequently changing obstacles. This results in a high average jerk along the robot's travel, as all disruptions stem from authentic and process-aligned task execution without any intentional human-robot interaction or artificial contrivance.",
