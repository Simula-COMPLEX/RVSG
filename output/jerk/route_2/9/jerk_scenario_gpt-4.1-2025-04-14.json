  "scenario": "During a midweek kitting surge combined with live problem-part escalation, two human workers independently—but with overlapping timing and space—move across the warehouse to fulfill multi-order kit assembly and exception item resolution. Worker 1 assembles kits from Large Shelf 4 and Shelf 3, constantly crossing main aisles to Area 3 and frequently staging kit components or partially built kits in corridor nodes (F15, E14, H16) when operational zones are full. Worker 2 continuously collects flagged items from Shelf 2, Shelf 3, and Large Shelf 4 for urgent inspection, using Area 2 or, if crowded, corridor staging at E14, F14, or H15; subsequently, problematic items are routed to the Waste Area or back toward storage, often pausing at central waypoints due to ongoing kitting congestion. The high-throughput, unsynchronized, and overflow-driven nature of both workflows ensures frequent, unpredictable worker and object occupancy directly along the robot's fixed route (M21 to E14), causing the robot to repeatedly decelerate, halt, and accelerate whenever obstacles appear or clear. This sustained, environment-driven corridor congestion generates a high average jerk in the robot's trajectory, all arising solely from authentic process requirements without direct human-robot coordination or intent to interfere.",
