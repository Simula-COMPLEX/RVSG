  "scenario": "During an urgent peak-order period, two human workers operate in parallel but overlapping workflows in the warehouse. Worker 1 continuously restocks fast-moving items from Boxes 2 and Large Shelf 2 to Shelf 2 and Shelf 3, frequently staging excess stock temporarily in Area 2 due to limited shelf availability. Worker 2 performs high-frequency order picking for urgent dispatch, withdrawing items from Shelf 2, Shelf 3, Large Shelf 4, and Area 5, assembling orders in Area 4 and sometimes temporarily using Area 3 for multi-SKU batches. Both workers must regularly access central shelves and staging zones (Areas 2, 3, and 4), unpredictably occupying or placing objects in the robot’s primary pathway (M21 to E14) and its adjacent critical waypoints. The resulting congestion—caused by frequent, unscheduled placement of carts, boxes, and worker presence—induces a high average jerk in the robot’s trajectory as it must often decelerate, stop, and accelerate abruptly to navigate around newly appearing human and object obstacles. All interference stems solely from legitimate workflow pressure, not any explicit coordination or intent to hinder the robot.",
