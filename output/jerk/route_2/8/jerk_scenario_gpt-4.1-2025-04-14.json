  "scenario": "During a combined mid-shift cycle preparation and on-the-fly cross-docking operation, Worker 1 continuously pulls inventory from Boxes 1 and Large Shelf 1 for cycle prep, staging and relabeling items in Areas 1 and 2 before transporting them to Shelf 2 and Shelf 3—often placing staging cages and overflow stock in main aisle waypoints (notably F14, G15, H15, E14) when operational zones are full. Simultaneously, Worker 2 manages urgent inbound cross-docking from Large Shelf 4, rapidly transferring goods through Area 5, splitting and sorting for dispatch in Area 3 or 4 as needed, with frequent interim staging and pallet assembly in central corridor points (K18, J17, F15, E14) due to overwhelmed operational areas. Both workers’ independently-timed, unsynchronized workflows force them to share critical access points and congest main pathways, repeatedly placing objects and themselves along the robot’s fixed route (M21 to E14). The robot, operating fully autonomously and responding only to environmental obstacles, must frequently decelerate, halt, and abruptly resume or reroute as paths are blocked by humans, roll cages, or staged inventory, resulting in a high average jerk driven solely by complex, real-world congestion from cycle and cross-dock surge overlap.",
