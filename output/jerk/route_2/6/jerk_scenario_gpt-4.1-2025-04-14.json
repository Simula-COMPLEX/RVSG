  "scenario": "During a high-intensity seasonal promotion setup, Worker 1 assembles promo kits by collecting components from Large Shelf 4, Boxes 3, Shelf 3, and the Waste Area, moving between these storage zones and conducting kit assembly in Area 2 or overflowing into the main corridor near F14 when staging space is limited. Worker 2 simultaneously performs shelf clearing and bulk restocking, transferring items between Shelf 2 and Large Shelf 1, often pausing or temporarily staging inventory in Area 3, H15, F15, or E14 when shelves or verification are backed up, and sometimes crossing into Area 1 to assist with priority SKU positioning. Both workers’ legitimate, unsynchronized, and high-frequency operations repeatedly require them to occupy, cross, or place items along the robot’s fixed route (from M21 to E14), particularly congesting critical points like E14 and F14. These unpredictable, process-driven overlaps and temporary obstructions force the robot to frequently stop, decelerate, and abruptly resume movement in response to ever-changing physical obstacles, resulting in a sustained high average jerk. All environmental disruptions stem solely from realistic operational workflow pressures and spillover, with no deliberate interference or direct interaction.",
