  "scenario": "During a quarterly inventory reconciliation, two workers simultaneously perform batch SKU relabeling and high-priority stock realignment in overlapping warehouse corridors. Worker 1 transfers pallets and mixed inventory between Large Shelf 3, Boxes 1, and Area 3 for relabeling, frequently staging mobile racks and completed goods along the main G12–F18 corridor. Worker 2 retrieves high-demand stock from Shelf 6, audits and prepares it in Area 2, and relies on Area 3 and the corridor for transfer and restocking, often using the same staging space for overflow. The workers' uncoordinated, parallel workflows force repeated shared use and temporary occupation of the robot’s fixed path from Area 3 (G12) to Shelf 6 (E21), with equipment and goods unpredictably parked or maneuvered across the route. As a result, the robot frequently encounters dynamic and short-lived obstructions, necessitating rapid, repeated adjustments in speed and path, which significantly increases its average jerk during task execution.",
