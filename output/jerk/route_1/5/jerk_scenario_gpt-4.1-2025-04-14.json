  "scenario": "A shipment of fragile, high-value items requires multi-step manual handling. Worker 1 retrieves unsorted items from Boxes 1, cleaning and checking them in Area 1 and then staging each item at Area 3. Worker 2 concurrently performs photographic documentation and recordkeeping in Area 3, then moves items one by one to Shelf 6 for storage, periodically collecting documentation tools or totes from Shelf 3 and Large Shelf 3. Both workers repeatedly access and physically share Area 3 and the adjacent corridor, often pausing for sorting, documentation, or supply collection, and sometimes staging items or totes in the very space (G12–E21 corridor) used by the robot. Their overlapping, unsynchronized actions—high-frequency pausing, shared workflow staging, and unpredictable object placement—cause frequent, short-lived corridor obstructions and rapid changes in the robot's environment. As the autonomous robot attempts to transit its fixed route from Area 3 (G12) to Shelf 6 (E21), it must repeatedly decelerate, halt, or resume abruptly in response to these dynamic obstructions, leading to a consistently high average jerk value. Unlike prior cases, the scenario’s novelty lies in both workers’ partially overlapping, alternating, and unsynchronized use of the core corridor for distinct yet tightly coupled functions, with Area 3 serving as a shared manual handoff, documentation, and staging hub, producing persistent, unpredictable localized congestion and high robot motion disruption that emerges solely from authentic operational workflow requirements.",
