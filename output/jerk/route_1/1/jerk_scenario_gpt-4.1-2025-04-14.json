  "scenario": "In response to a sudden surge order requiring rapid dispatch of long-term stored goods, two warehouse workers engage in a tightly coupled dual-stage quality assurance and packing operation. Worker 1 retrieves items from Boxes 2 and 3 (Region 1), performs inspection in Area 2, and stages approved or rejected items in Areas 3 and the Waste Area, respectively, with frequent circuitous paths between these regions. Worker 2 simultaneously retrieves inspected items from Area 3 for packing, moves packed stock to Area 5 for outbound staging, and regularly replenishes packing supplies from Large Shelf 4, repeatedly crossing the main corridor. Both workers often operate in overlapping zones (particularly Areas 2, 3, and 5), sometimes converging at Area 3 or staging temporary bins, pallets, or rejected stock along the main G12–E21 corridor. The frequent, unpredictable occupation of shared workspace and transient blockage of the robot’s fixed transport route cause the robot to repeatedly decelerate, halt, or rapidly resume motion in response to dynamic, human-created obstructions. This dense, parallel operational flow indirectly induces higher average jerk in the robot’s execution as it navigates between staging (G12) and Shelf 6 (E21), accurately reflecting realistic workflow and environment-driven disruption.",
