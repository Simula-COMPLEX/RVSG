  "scenario": "During a high-throughput 'Returns and Reprocessing' cycle, two workers independently perform alternating and sometimes simultaneous sorting and reintegration tasks that converge at Area 3, causing unpredictable environmental changes along the robot's fixed route (G12–E21). Worker 1 manages returned goods by sorting at Area 1/2 and moving usable items into Area 3 for reintegration, while intermittently staging totes along central corridors. Worker 2 retrieves bulky or salvage items from Large Shelf 1/2, transports these to Area 3 for inspection and repacking, and moves processed items toward Shelf 6. Both frequently use Area 3 as a transfer or staging point, occasionally crowding the robot's corridor with totes, boxes, or large items. The spatial overlap, lack of coordination, and dynamic, ad-hoc placement of goods result in frequent, unpredictable obstructions and temporary blockages along the G12–E21 route, causing the autonomous robot to repeatedly decelerate, halt, or accelerate as it negotiates rapidly changing obstacles—substantially increasing its average jerk value during execution. This scenario reflects realistic, process-driven causes of high-frequency robot disruption in a multi-process, high-activity warehouse environment.",
