  "scenario": "During a peak outbound mixed-load palletization operation timed around unpredictable carrier pickups, two workers independently manage rolling-cart pick–sort–stage cycles, each responsible for both sourcing and staging their assigned pallet batch. Worker 1 retrieves heavy and bulky items from Large Shelves 3 and 4, repeatedly loading a rolling cart, traversing the lower corridor, and offloading overflow near Area 4—including direct, temporary placement of goods and carts within the G16–E18 segment of the robot’s fixed path. Concurrently, Worker 2 gathers fragile stock from Shelf 3, rapidly shuttling carts to and from Area 3, then temporarily drops item totes and bins along the G14–E17 corridor as buffer space before final consolidation. With no direct coordination, both workers’ rolling carts and overflow regularly occupy and intermittently block the central robot navigation lane as real operational needs drive unpredictable placement, staging, and pause locations. The robot, traversing G12 to E21, repeatedly detects and responds to transient, variably located obstacles—often both humans and carts—in the shared workspace, resulting in frequent, rapid stops, accelerations, and motion adjustments. This pathway congestion, generated indirectly by overlapping rolling-cart cycles and dual-worker corridor staging, leads to a consistently elevated robot average jerk due to the highly stochastic, operationally realistic disruptions caused by complex outbound palletizing under genuine workflow constraints.",
