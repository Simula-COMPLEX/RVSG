  "scenario": "During an urgent, unscheduled cycle count coinciding with dynamic Kanban tote replenishment, two workers independently perform overlapping audit and restock operations across the warehouse. Worker 1 moves audit bins and paperwork between Area 5, Shelves 4–6, and Boxes 3, staging partial count totes and inventory adjustments in corridor segments adjacent to the robot’s fixed G12–E21 path. Worker 2 simultaneously restocks high-frequency totes from Large Shelf 2 to Shelves 4–6 and Areas 3–4, repeatedly pushing and parking replenishment carts or bins along the same corridor for sorting and supply swapping. Both workers frequently stage totes, containers, or materials temporarily in the robot’s navigation lanes due to crowded workflow, causing intermittent, unpredictable obstructions. The robot, operating autonomously, must repeatedly adjust motion—often abruptly—to avoid these dynamic blockages, resulting in a significantly increased average jerk solely due to natural operational congestion and indirect workflow-driven disruption.",
