  "scenario": "During a peak receiving and restocking period, two warehouse workers process incoming freight in parallel. Worker 1 unloads and inspects new stock at Areas 1 and 2 before replenishing frequently accessed Shelf 5 and Shelf 6, moving repeatedly through core corridors (F12–F18, E18–E21). Worker 2 alternates between sorting, staging, and cross-stocking, often operating in the same lanes and sometimes assisting Worker 1 with shelf loading, or collecting supplies from Large Shelf 2 and returning via the same corridor. Both regularly transport, temporarily stage, or adjust items near the robot's fixed navigation path between Area 3 (G12) and Shelf 6 (E21), resulting in unpredictable obstructions, close-proximity human activity, and occasional partial blockages. The robot, operating autonomously, encounters frequent and unexpected obstacles, requiring repeated rapid changes in speed and path—significantly increasing its average jerk as it navigates from G12 to E21 amidst high human activity.",
