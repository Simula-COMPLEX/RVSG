Worker 1 unloads and inspects new stock at Areas 1 and 2 before replenishing frequently accessed Shelf 5 and Shelf 6, moving repeatedly through core corridors (F12–F18, E18–E21). Worker 2 alternates between sorting, staging, and cross-stocking, often operating in the same lanes and sometimes assisting Worker 1 with shelf loading, or collecting supplies from Large Shelf 2 and returning via the same corridor. Both regularly transport, temporarily stage, or adjust items near the robot's fixed navigation path between Area 3 (G12) and Shelf 6 (E21), resulting in unpredictable obstructions, close-proximity human activity, and occasional partial blockages. The robot, operating autonomously, encounters frequent and unexpected obstacles, requiring repeated rapid changes in speed and path—significantly increasing its average jerk as it navigates from G12 to E21 amidst high human activity.",

Worker 1 retrieves items from Boxes 2 and 3 (Region 1), performs inspection in Area 2, and stages approved or rejected items in Areas 3 and the Waste Area, respectively, with frequent circuitous paths between these regions. Worker 2 simultaneously retrieves inspected items from Area 3 for packing, moves packed stock to Area 5 for outbound staging, and regularly replenishes packing supplies from Large Shelf 4, repeatedly crossing the main corridor. Both workers often operate in overlapping zones (particularly Areas 2, 3, and 5), sometimes converging at Area 3 or staging temporary bins, pallets, or rejected stock along the main G12–E21 corridor. The frequent, unpredictable occupation of shared workspace and transient blockage of the robot’s fixed transport route cause the robot to repeatedly decelerate, halt, or rapidly resume motion in response to dynamic, human-created obstructions. This dense, parallel operational flow indirectly induces higher average jerk in the robot’s execution as it navigates between staging (G12) and Shelf 6 (E21), accurately reflecting realistic workflow and environment-driven disruption.",

Worker 1 retrieves unsorted items from Boxes 1, cleaning and checking them in Area 1 and then staging each item at Area 3. Worker 2 concurrently performs photographic documentation and recordkeeping in Area 3, then moves items one by one to Shelf 6 for storage, periodically collecting documentation tools or totes from Shelf 3 and Large Shelf 3. Both workers repeatedly access and physically share Area 3 and the adjacent corridor, often pausing for sorting, documentation, or supply collection, and sometimes staging items or totes in the very space (G12–E21 corridor) used by the robot. Their overlapping, unsynchronized actions—high-frequency pausing, shared workflow staging, and unpredictable object placement—cause frequent, short-lived corridor obstructions and rapid changes in the robot's environment. As the autonomous robot attempts to transit its fixed route from Area 3 (G12) to Shelf 6 (E21), it must repeatedly decelerate, halt, or resume abruptly in response to these dynamic obstructions, leading to a consistently high average jerk value. Unlike prior cases, the scenario’s novelty lies in both workers’ partially overlapping, alternating, and unsynchronized use of the core corridor for distinct yet tightly coupled functions, with Area 3 serving as a shared manual handoff, documentation, and staging hub, producing persistent, unpredictable localized congestion and high robot motion disruption that emerges solely from authentic operational workflow requirements.",

Simultaneously, Worker 2 conducts urgent returns processing, pushing a cart loaded with unpacked returns from Pallet Jack to Area 5 and Area 3 for triage, restocking some items directly to Shelf 1/4, and discarding non-restockable items at the Waste Area. Both continuously cycle between Area 3 and other warehouse zones, often pausing to sort, assemble, or stage items and occasionally leaving carts or bins—sometimes side-by-side or at odd angles—in the same main corridor. Their naturally uncoordinated, overlapping activities cause frequent, rapidly changing obstructions and congestion along the robot's fixed G12–E21 navigation route. The autonomous robot, detecting and responding only to physical obstructions, is forced into repeated sudden stops, rapid accelerations, and abrupt re-routes as the pathway is unpredictably blocked or cleared—leading to consistently high average jerk values. This scenario’s distinctiveness lies in the high-frequency, multi-process overlap surrounding Area 3, with both workers' legitimate operational needs causing authentic, unscripted corridor blockages that maximize robot motion disruption through realistic workflow-driven environmental interference.",

Concurrently, Worker 2 gathers fragile stock from Shelf 3, rapidly shuttling carts to and from Area 3, then temporarily drops item totes and bins along the G14–E17 corridor as buffer space before final consolidation. With no direct coordination, both workers’ rolling carts and overflow regularly occupy and intermittently block the central robot navigation lane as real operational needs drive unpredictable placement, staging, and pause locations. The robot, traversing G12 to E21, repeatedly detects and responds to transient, variably located obstacles—often both humans and carts—in the shared workspace, resulting in frequent, rapid stops, accelerations, and motion adjustments. This pathway congestion, generated indirectly by overlapping rolling-cart cycles and dual-worker corridor staging, leads to a consistently elevated robot average jerk due to the highly stochastic, operationally realistic disruptions caused by complex outbound palletizing under genuine workflow constraints.",
