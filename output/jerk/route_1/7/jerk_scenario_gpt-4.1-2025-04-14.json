  "scenario": "During an intense morning block, Worker 1 rapidly assembles partial outbound orders by shuttling between Large Shelf 1, Boxes 2 and 3, and Area 3, repeatedly staging SKUs, cartons, and bins in the very corridor forming the robot’s fixed G12–E21 path. Simultaneously, Worker 2 conducts urgent returns processing, pushing a cart loaded with unpacked returns from Pallet Jack to Area 5 and Area 3 for triage, restocking some items directly to Shelf 1/4, and discarding non-restockable items at the Waste Area. Both continuously cycle between Area 3 and other warehouse zones, often pausing to sort, assemble, or stage items and occasionally leaving carts or bins—sometimes side-by-side or at odd angles—in the same main corridor. Their naturally uncoordinated, overlapping activities cause frequent, rapidly changing obstructions and congestion along the robot's fixed G12–E21 navigation route. The autonomous robot, detecting and responding only to physical obstructions, is forced into repeated sudden stops, rapid accelerations, and abrupt re-routes as the pathway is unpredictably blocked or cleared—leading to consistently high average jerk values. This scenario’s distinctiveness lies in the high-frequency, multi-process overlap surrounding Area 3, with both workers' legitimate operational needs causing authentic, unscripted corridor blockages that maximize robot motion disruption through realistic workflow-driven environmental interference.",
