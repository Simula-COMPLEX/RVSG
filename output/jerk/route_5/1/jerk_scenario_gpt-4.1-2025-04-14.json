  "scenario": "During an end-of-quarter cycle-count and hazardous waste segregation period coinciding with active dispatch, Worker 1 repeatedly transfers large items from Large Shelves 2 and 3 to Areas 3 and 4 for inspection and then stages them temporarily along the main G-row corridor near G13–G18 as accessible floor space is limited by ongoing staging for dispatch. Worker 2 simultaneously retrieves and sorts potentially hazardous boxes from Region 1, verifying items in Area 2 and moving flagged components to the Waste Area via the corridor, periodically leaving trolleys or cartons beside the robot’s fixed path at G7–G11 while analyzing contents. Both workers often occupy the same corridor segments, sometimes creating temporary dual-sided obstructions as their cycles overlap. As a result, the robot, traveling from Area 5 (G19) to the Waste Area (G3) along a fixed route, encounters frequent, unpredictable obstacles—including staged, bulk objects and transiently parked bins or trolleys—that force abrupt stops, sharp course adjustments, and rapid restarts, resulting in consistently high average jerk throughout its route. All disruptions stem from genuine, simultaneous workflow requirements and emergent spatial congestion, with no deliberate interference or direct human-robot interaction.",
