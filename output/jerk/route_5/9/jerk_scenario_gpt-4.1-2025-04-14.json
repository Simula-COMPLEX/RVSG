  "scenario": "During a peak end-of-month mixed SKU sorting and dual-stream dispatch preparation operation, two workers are assigned to simultaneous, partially overlapping workflows driving both outbound order shipping and urgent intra-warehouse restocking. Worker 1 picks, sorts, and stages labeled outbound items from Shelves 1–4 to Areas 1 and 4, repeatedly using the main corridor (G3–G19) to stage shipments directly on the waypoints between G5–G12 and temporarily parking bins or trolleys at corridor endpoints (G3 and G19) during peak outbound traffic. Worker 2 concurrently retrieves, inspects, and relabels inbound stock from Large Shelves 2 and 3 and Boxes 3, cycling these through Area 2 and staging overflow or backlogged stock in Area 5, frequently placing or moving bulk items and bins within corridor segments G15–G19 and G11–G15 and occasionally leaving empties near G19 as Area 5 fills. Both workers must repeatedly cross or pause in the robot’s fixed path from Area 5 (G19) to Waste Area (G3), often simultaneously moving in opposite directions or staging items in the corridor at midpoints, endpoints, or entry/exit zones, without coordination or awareness of the robot's routine. These authentic process flows result in variable, dynamic obstructions, with moving workers, staged trolleys, and bins causing unpredictable and frequent micro-blockages. As a result, the robot—reacting solely to environmental changes—experiences repeated abrupt stops, rapid accelerations, and sharp path adjustments as it attempts to follow its fixed route, leading to a consistently elevated average jerk. All disruptions arise purely from high-throughput, legitimate operational density and workflow overlap typical of peak warehouse activity.",
