  "scenario": "During an unplanned bulk restocking event coinciding with a scheduled quarterly cycle stock count, two workers must simultaneously operate in overlapping zones: Worker 1 conducts detailed cycle counts in Boxes 1–2, Large Shelf 1, and Shelf 3, physically relocating items to Areas 1 and 2 for verification and staging temporary 'count-in-progress' piles directly in the G-row corridor near G7–G12. Worker 2 moves bulk items from Area 5 using the pallet jack, staging them at Large Shelves 2–3, Shelf 5, and Area 2, but frequently leaves bulk items, packaging, or the pallet jack itself parked at various corridor points (G13–G17, G10) while shuttling goods or resolving space conflicts with Worker 1. Both workers must repeatedly cross or jointly occupy the G-row corridor between G8 and G17, sometimes simultaneously stacking or handling items along the robot’s fixed path. The robot, tasked with hauling waste from Area 5 (G19) to the Waste Area (G3), encounters near-constant dynamic obstacles caused by worker presence, staged objects, or parked equipment, forcing abrupt stops, rapid accelerations, and sharp course adjustments multiple times along its route. All disruptions are legitimate byproducts of overlapping audit and restocking workflows in a shared, congested central corridor, reflecting realistic operational needs that drive sustained high average jerk in the robot’s navigation, with no intentional interference or direct human-robot interaction.",
