  "scenario": "During a peak returns week combined with a scheduled stock rotation period, two workers execute overlapping operational flows. Worker 1 retrieves returned items from Boxes 3 and carries them to Area 1 for triage, then shuttles non-resalable or defective items through the G-row corridor to Area 5. Due to volume, Worker 1 frequently stages returns, bins, or pallets temporarily along G9–G14 before space opens in operational zones. Worker 2 removes older stock from Large Shelf 1 and 2, restocking them in Area 2 for labeling, while also assisting with secondary inspection and waste identification in Area 5. Worker 2 frequently shuttles relabeled stock and waste between Areas 2, 5, and the Waste Area, sometimes parking the pallet jack or bins along G10–G13 as he alternates tasks. These legitimate, high-density workflows cause both workers and their staged materials or equipment to frequently occupy or block segments of the G-row fixed robot route from G19 (Area 5) to G3 (Waste Area). The result is persistent, unpredictable congestion: the robot is repeatedly forced to stop, rapidly accelerate, or sharply reroute due to ever-changing obstacles, leading to consistently high average jerk. All disruptions arise solely from legitimate collaborate and overlapping operational activities, with no direct human-robot interaction or intent to interfere.",
