  "scenario": "During a regulatory serialization audit combined with a launch of a reusable materials cross-dock pilot, two workers execute complex, overlapping workflows in the shared warehouse corridor. Worker 1 retrieves mixed SKUs from Boxes 1–2 and Shelves 4–5, cycles them through Areas 2 and 3 for audit and relabeling, and stages non-compliant batches in Area 5, often temporarily leaving bins or pallets at corridor points G5, G12, or G16. Worker 2 concurrently extracts, inspects, and sorts reusable packaging from Large Shelves 1–4, consolidates materials in Area 4 or 5, then dispatches them for reuse or waste, regularly using the pallet jack and staging it—along with packaging bins—at G9, G15, or G19. Both workers repeatedly share, cross, or pause in the robot’s fixed G-row (G19–G3) route, with emergent corridor congestion as bins, staging lots, or equipment are placed along several key waypoints during bottlenecks or task handovers. The robot, tasked to move material from Area 5 to the Waste Area (G19→G3), must navigate an unpredictable, highly dynamic obstacle field, with frequent abrupt stops and sharp accelerations due solely to real-time, legitimate workflow-driven corridor occupation and shifting object placement. This results in consistently elevated jerk values as the robot’s route is repeatedly and variably disrupted by the environment, not by any intentional human-robot interaction.",
