  "scenario": "During a flash-sale-driven order fulfillment rush combined with an urgent restock cycle, Worker 1 picks high-priority SKUs from Regions 1, 2, and 4, staging and consolidating items in Areas 1, 2, and periodically along Row G (columns 6–15). To accommodate order changes, Worker 1 frequently revisits Area 5 and temporarily leaves items or carts in the main G-row corridor. Worker 2 rapidly retrieves bulk and priority inventory from Regions 1 and 4, replenishing Shelves 3–5 and performing QA checks in Areas 2, 4, and sometimes directly in the G-row corridor or at Area 5, frequently using and leaving the pallet jack or a restock trolley in the corridor (columns 10, 14–19) while shifting between restocking and inspection. Both workers repeatedly cross the primary G row (G19–G3), often simultaneously, each unintentionally obstructing or narrowing the robot's fixed path by personal presence and impromptu item/equipment staging. This creates dynamic, emergent obstacles—bins, carts, large items, or human presence—that shift unpredictably along the route, forcing the robot to continually stop, abruptly adjust speed, or rapidly reroute, resulting in a consistently elevated average jerk purely as a byproduct of real, high-density warehouse activity. All congestion and disruptions arise from legitimate workflow overlap and stochastic process needs, not by design or intent.",
