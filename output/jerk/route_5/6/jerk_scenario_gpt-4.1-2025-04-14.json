  "scenario": "During an emergency inbound contamination control and waste processing operation, Worker 1 repeatedly retrieves potentially contaminated goods from Large Shelf 4 and Boxes 3, cycling them through Area 2 for inspection, then staging or discarding flagged items in Area 5. Worker 2 actively removes rejected or contaminated items from Area 5 to the Waste Area, while simultaneously fetching replacement containers and safety equipment from Shelves 2 and 6, and returning empties to Area 4. Both workers make frequent, overlapping trips across the main G-row corridor, often occupying or blocking critical path segments (G19–G10, G6–G3) with mobile bins, carts, or goods awaiting triage or clearance. Space constraints and urgent workflow requirements force them to stage objects and equipment directly in the robot’s fixed path, sometimes leaving multiple obstacles at different points along the route as operations intensify. The robot, tasked with transporting waste from Area 5 (G19) to the Waste Area (G3), must repeatedly halt, sharply accelerate, or reroute as it encounters new obstructions—leading to persistent, high average jerk solely due to the authentic, high-stress overlap of crisis-driven human workflows in the shared corridor. All disruptions result from necessary operational requirements and dynamic congestion during the emergency response, with no direct human-robot interaction or intent.",
