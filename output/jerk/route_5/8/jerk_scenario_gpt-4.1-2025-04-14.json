  "scenario": "During an urgent post-audit anomaly investigation and cross-zone repackaging operation, Worker 1 retrieves full boxes from Boxes 3 for repackaging and anomaly check in Area 1, then moves verified goods to Shelf 2 and flagged/damaged boxes to Area 4 and, if needed, further to Area 5 for waste staging. Worker 2 concurrently collects bulk items from Large Shelf 4, repackages and inspects them in Area 2, moves verified items to Shelf 5, and routes problematic ones to Area 5. Worker 2 also periodically aggregates all waste from Area 5, making batch trips to the Waste Area. Both workers constantly cross the main G-row corridor for transitions, staging, and temporary holding due to congestion, frequently leaving boxes, bulk items, carts, or the pallet jack adjacent to or in the corridor at G11–G18 during busy periods. Frequent simultaneous use of Area 5 and shared corridor staging for unallocated or waste items create multiple emergent obstructions and unpredictable bottlenecks directly in the robot’s fixed G19→G3 route. As a result, the robot must repeatedly halt, sharply accelerate, or reroute in response to new, dynamically-placed obstacles, resulting in sustained high average jerk due solely to the authentic, overlapping, and high-throughput nature of the scenario’s repackaging, inspection, and waste processes. All disruptions are byproducts of legitimate workflow pressure, urgent anomaly processing, and natural spatial congestion.",
