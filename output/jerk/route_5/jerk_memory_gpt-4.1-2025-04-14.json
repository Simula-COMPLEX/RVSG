    "summary": "During a peak operational window, two workers are tasked with overlapping workflows: Worker 1 handles incoming product receipt, unpacking in Areas 1 and 2, and staging rejected items in Area 5; Worker 2 consolidates and transports waste from Area 5 to the Waste Area, also performing supplementary inspections in Area 2. Both workers frequently traverse and occupy the main corridor along row G (columns 8–19) as they move products or waste, often simultaneously transferring or staging items right in or adjacent to the robot’s fixed path. Worker 2 intermittently uses the pallet jack or a cart, sometimes parking these temporarily in the corridor due to congestion. As a result, the robot—responsible for transporting waste from Area 5 (G19) to the Waste Area (G3) on a fixed path—repeatedly encounters new dynamic obstacles (workers, objects, carts) along its route, forcing repeated abrupt stops, starts, and sharp path adjustments in real time, thus experiencing a consistently high average jerk value. These disruptions are solely due to legitimate, workflow-driven human activities intrinsic to high-throughput warehouse operations.",

Worker 1 retrieves returned items from Boxes 3 and carries them to Area 1 for triage, then shuttles non-resalable or defective items through the G-row corridor to Area 5. Due to volume, Worker 1 frequently stages returns, bins, or pallets temporarily along G9–G14 before space opens in operational zones.

Worker 2 frequently shuttles relabeled stock and waste between Areas 2, 5, and the Waste Area, sometimes parking the pallet jack or bins along G10–G13 as he alternates tasks. These legitimate, high-density workflows cause both workers and their staged materials or equipment to frequently occupy or block segments of the G-row fixed robot route from G19 (Area 5) to G3 (Waste Area).
