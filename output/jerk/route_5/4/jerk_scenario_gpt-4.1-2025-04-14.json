  "scenario": "During a comprehensive compliance audit and cross-training week, two workers are cross-assigned to rolling audit and traceability tasks, requiring frequent cross-zonal movement and collaborative checking of all major storage modules. Worker 1 continuously audits and extracts samples from all boxes and Shelves 1–2, cycling them through Area 1 for content verification and relocating non-compliant candidates to Area 5 for joint review or temporary staging at G11–G15. Worker 2 simultaneously audits select inventory from Large Shelves 1 and 4, and Shelves 5–6, often transporting samples for documentation at Area 4, then to Area 5 or the G13–G18 corridor pending joint clearance and batch handoff. Both workers routinely traverse, stage, or operate within the G-row corridor (G19–G3), frequently generating dynamic obstructions by leaving bins, carts, or mobile audit setups in path segments awaiting approval, or by stepwise working side-by-side during peak workflow crossover. The robot, tasked with carrying waste from Area 5 to the Waste Area along the fixed G-row route, faces frequent, unpredictable stops, sharp accelerations, and abrupt course adjustments as it navigates a corridor crowded with human activity and transiently staged materials—triggered solely by the high-density, cross-functional audit operation and not by any coordinated interference. This produces a consistently high average jerk, reflecting realistic audit-driven, space-sharing congestion and the fluid, emergent dynamics of real compliance operations.",
