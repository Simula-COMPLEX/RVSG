  "scenario": "During a high-frequency restocking surge combined with aggressive empty tote recirculation after a major batch pick, Worker 1 performs repeated rapid replenishment of Shelves 1–6 with cases retrieved from Large Shelf 1 and 2, frequently picking up and moving misplaced empty totes from central corridors or staging zones to Area 5. Concurrently, Worker 2 systematically collects empty totes from all active areas (Area 2, 4, 5), including those blocking main aisles, aggressively sorts or stages them in Area 4 for audit or handoff, then shuttles stacks to the Waste Area or Large Shelf 4 for recirculation. Both workers independently, yet often asynchronously or even briefly simultaneously, occupy, block, or traverse the main horizontal and central vertical corridors directly along the robot's fixed transfer path (M5 to H17). Their legitimate and urgent operational actions—temporarily stacking, staging, or relaying empty bins and cases at dynamic corridor points—create frequent, unpredictable new obstructions that force the robot to sharply decelerate, pause, accelerate, or detour, repeatedly increasing the rate of change of acceleration (jerk) over its entire route. This scenario is distinct in its focus on the environmental turbulence caused by competitive tote management and restocking overlap, rather than standard picking, sorting, or waste processing, and presents authentic, real-world conditions driving elevated robot jerk.",
