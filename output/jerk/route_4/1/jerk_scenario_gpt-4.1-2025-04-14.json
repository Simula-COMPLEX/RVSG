  "scenario": "During an end-of-week outbound consolidation and mandatory inventory spot check event, Worker 1 is responsible for gathering oversized items from both Large Shelf 1 and 2, staging them for dispatch in Area 4, and frequently retrieving packaging from Area 5. Meanwhile, Worker 2 conducts rolling spot-checks across Area 2, Shelf 3, Area 1, and both Large Shelves, recording findings in Area 4. Both routinely use mobile carts and bulky loads, which are temporarily staged in or adjacent to the robot’s fixed route (M5 to H17) along key corridor waypoints. Their independent yet interleaved operations create frequent, dynamic path obstructions and congestion, particularly in the shared main aisle and Area 4 approaches. This configuration naturally results in the robot encountering intermittent, unpredictable blockages—requiring it to repeatedly decelerate, halt, or sharply alter course, significantly raising its average jerk. All worker tasks and spatial interactions stem directly from legitimate outbound and compliance-driven workflow requirements.",
