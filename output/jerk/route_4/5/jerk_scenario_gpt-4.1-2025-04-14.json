  "scenario": "During an urgent outbound kitting drive combined with incident-based damaged goods retrieval, Worker 1 rapidly assembles multi-item kits for high-priority orders by collecting components from Large Shelf 1 and 3, Shelf 5, and Boxes 2, repeatedly staging and packing kits at Area 4. Meanwhile, Worker 2 concurrently collects damaged items from Boxes 3, Shelf 6, and Area 1, transporting them to Area 4 for assessment and then to the Waste Area for disposal as needed. Both workers make frequent, time-sensitive trips using shared corridors and regularly stage bins, trolleys, or incomplete kit loads in central aisle ways, especially at intersections along the robot’s fixed route from M5 to H17. The intensive, overlapping workflow at Area 4 results in unpredictable, dynamic obstacles and blockages directly in the robot's travel path. As a result, the robot repeatedly encounters abrupt new obstacles, requiring frequent stops, sharp decelerations, and detours, which significantly increases its average jerk. All disruptions stem from natural, independently urgent human workflows, not deliberate interference, and reflect authentic, high-pressure warehouse operations.",
