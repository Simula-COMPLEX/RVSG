    "summary": "During a peak receiving and inspection period, two human workers rapidly process incoming goods. Worker 1 fetches received items from the Waste Area and Area 1, delivering them repeatedly to sorting Areas 2 and 4. Meanwhile, Worker 2 sorts and inspects items primarily in Area 4, continuously moving inspected goods to Area 5, shelves, and back to sorting zones. Both workers frequently traverse, occupy, or temporarily block the main corridor aligning with the robot’s fixed transfer route from Large Shelf 1 (M5) to Area 4 (H17). Their overlapping, alternating, and occasionally simultaneous tasks result in intermittent obstructions, dynamic congestion, and temporary placement of items within the robot’s path. Consequently, the robot, which only reacts to environmental changes, is often forced to sharply decelerate, accelerate, or maneuver to avoid new obstacles—leading to increased average jerk along its route. All worker tasks are a natural result of operational requirements and workflow urgency, reflecting realistic scenarios in busy warehouse environments.",

Meanwhile, Worker 2 conducts rolling spot-checks across Area 2, Shelf 3, Area 1, and both Large Shelves, recording findings in Area 4. Both routinely use mobile carts and bulky loads, which are temporarily staged in or adjacent to the robot’s fixed route (M5 to H17) along key corridor waypoints. Their independent yet interleaved operations create frequent, dynamic path obstructions and congestion, particularly in the shared main aisle and Area 4 approaches. This configuration naturally results in the robot encountering intermittent, unpredictable blockages—requiring it to repeatedly decelerate, halt, or sharply alter course, significantly raising its average jerk.
