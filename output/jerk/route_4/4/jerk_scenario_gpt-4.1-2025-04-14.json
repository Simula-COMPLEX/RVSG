  "scenario": "During a simultaneous quarter-end cycle count audit and urgent overflow relocation, Worker 1 systematically moves between Shelves 1–6 and Area 4 to verify, tag, and report high-value inventory, staging counted items in central lanes and occasionally leaving audit binders or temporary containers in the main corridor. Worker 2 independently relocates bulky overflow items from Boxes 1–3 and Large Shelf 3 to Area 4, often using the shortest path and partially blocking aisles with staged goods for rapid turnaround. Both workers repeatedly and asynchronously traverse and occupy the robot’s fixed route from Large Shelf 1 (M5) to Area 4 (H17), converging at central corridor intersections and Area 4 multiple times per cycle. Their uncoordinated, high-frequency movement and intermittent staging of goods and audit materials in shared aisles create unpredictable, temporary obstructions and dynamic congestion directly along the robot’s path. The robot, responding solely to environmental changes, must repeatedly slow, halt, or rapidly change direction to avoid new or shifting obstacles, leading to a substantially elevated average jerk. These disruptions arise naturally from legitimate, overlapping warehouse workflows typical of quarterly audit and fast-paced overflow processing operations.",
