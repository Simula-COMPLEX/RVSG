  "scenario": "During a simultaneous emergency stock recall and time-critical dispatch operation, Worker 1 urgently extracts and audits recalled SKUs from Shelves 2, 4, and Large Shelf 3, frequently staging audit bins or surplus carts in the main corridors and Area 4 approach zones. Concurrently, Worker 2 assembles high-priority outbound orders from Large Shelf 1, 4, and Shelves 1 & 5, rapidly consolidating, checking, and staging packages in Area 4 and central aisles. Both workers frequently overlap at Area 4 and along the robot’s fixed path (M5 to H17), independently and as a result of urgent operational requirements, creating unpredictable, intermittent, and shifting obstructions directly on or adjacent to the robot’s route. Their high-frequency, asynchronous cart movement, temporary item placement, and dynamic occupancy of shared main corridors cause the robot—reacting only to environmental changes—to repeatedly decelerate, accelerate, or reroute sharply, thereby increasing its average jerk. All disruptions arise from legitimate and time-critical workflow requirements, not intentional interference, accurately mirroring real warehouse operational stress scenarios.",
