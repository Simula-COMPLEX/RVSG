  "scenario": "During a high-pressure morning replenishment window, Worker 1 rapidly moves bulk and partially filled containers between Boxes 2/3 in Region 1 and Shelves 3 and 5 in Region 2, repeatedly restocking shelves and consolidating overflow. At the same time, Worker 2 retrieves split-pallets from Large Shelf 2 (Region 4), transporting them across the warehouse to Area 3 and Area 4 for outbound staging and repacking, while also preparing pick zones in Area 5. Both workers frequently converge at Area 4 and adjacent central aisles—Worker 1 staging restock overflow and Worker 2 pausing to break down pallets or temporarily place payloads for repack. Their asynchronous yet overlapping workflows create intermittent, unpredictable blockages and dynamic congestion directly along the robot’s fixed path (M5 to H17), resulting in the robot repeatedly encountering new obstructions, halts, and detours. This causes sharp, frequent changes in robot speed and route, substantially raising its average jerk. The scenario reflects realistic, unsynchronized split-pallet replenishment and dynamic slotting operations typical of a modern high-turnover warehouse environment.",
