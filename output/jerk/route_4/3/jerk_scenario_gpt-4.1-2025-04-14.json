  "scenario": "During a high-volume returns intake and concurrent waste processing period, Worker 1 cycles between Area 2, Area 5, and Area 4 to screen, sort, and reallocate returned items, frequently moving usable stock to Large Shelf 1 and non-compliant goods to the Waste Area. Worker 2 synchronously collects waste and surplus packaging from Area 1, Area 4, and Area 5, delivering packaging supplies from Large Shelf 2 and 3, and regularly transporting waste material to the Waste Area. Both workers repeatedly converge in Area 4 and along the main corridor, naturally blocking or cluttering the robot’s fixed route (M5 to H17) with bins, packaging, and returns in transit. Their overlapping and unsynchronized workflows within shared zones, especially at pickup (Large Shelf 1), central corridor segments, and Area 4, result in unpredictable, transient obstructions that force the robot to perform frequent, abrupt changes in speed and direction—significantly increasing its average jerk. These disruptions are a genuine byproduct of intense, time-sensitive warehouse activities rather than intentional interference.",
