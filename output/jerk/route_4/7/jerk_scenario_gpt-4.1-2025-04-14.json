  "scenario": "During a concurrent cycle picking and reverse logistics assessment operation, Worker 1 systematically cycles through Shelves 1–4 and Large Shelf 2 to assemble compact batch orders, frequently staging mounting order assemblies and oversize cartons in Area 4 and across main central corridors. Worker 2 rapidly collects returns from Boxes 1/3 and Large Shelves 1/4, delivering them for sorting and triage in Area 4, then shuttles usable stock to Area 2/Shelf 5 or disposes of rejects in the Waste Area. Their alternating, overlapping, and at times synchronous movements cause the central aisle and Area 4 approaches (especially along waypoints like K11-K12, J13-J14, and H17) to become intermittently blocked by mobile bins, staging carts, and temporary item piles. The unpredictably shifting corridor congestion and overflow of staged goods repeatedly force the robot, traveling its fixed M5→H17 route, to decelerate sharply, pause, or accelerate unexpectedly as new obstacles momentarily appear and clear, raising its average jerk. All disruptions result solely from operationally necessary, time-sensitive human workflow overlaps typical of high-density warehouse processing, with no deliberate interference or communication.",
