  "scenario": "During a peak receiving and inspection period, two human workers rapidly process incoming goods. Worker 1 fetches received items from the Waste Area and Area 1, delivering them repeatedly to sorting Areas 2 and 4. Meanwhile, Worker 2 sorts and inspects items primarily in Area 4, continuously moving inspected goods to Area 5, shelves, and back to sorting zones. Both workers frequently traverse, occupy, or temporarily block the main corridor aligning with the robot’s fixed transfer route from Large Shelf 1 (M5) to Area 4 (H17). Their overlapping, alternating, and occasionally simultaneous tasks result in intermittent obstructions, dynamic congestion, and temporary placement of items within the robot’s path. Consequently, the robot, which only reacts to environmental changes, is often forced to sharply decelerate, accelerate, or maneuver to avoid new obstacles—leading to increased average jerk along its route. All worker tasks are a natural result of operational requirements and workflow urgency, reflecting realistic scenarios in busy warehouse environments.",
