  "scenario": "During a mid-cycle inventory audit and stock reconciliation, Worker 1 performs repeated counts and reallocations between Shelf 1–3 and bulk storage (Boxes 1–3, Large Shelf 1), frequently traversing and pausing in the main E and F row corridors while moving carts and audit bins. Worker 2, as an inspector, stages items received from Worker 1 in both Area 1 and Area 2, expanding into corridor space when overwhelmed. Both workers periodically cross paths or temporarily leave transport carts, checked items, or inspection containers along the robot's fixed route (A9→G4), particularly at high-traffic navigation points (E9, E8, E7, F7), creating intermittent and unpredictable physical obstructions. The robot must continually decelerate, stop, or accelerate in response to these natural workflow-driven disruptions, causing a substantially higher average jerk. All human behaviors arise from genuine operational needs, with spatial and temporal overlaps emerging organically from the audit and staging process, ensuring realistic, indirect impact on the robot’s navigation.",
