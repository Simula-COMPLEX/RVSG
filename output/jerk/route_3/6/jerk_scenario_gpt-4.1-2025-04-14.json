  "scenario": "During an intensive bulk repacking and distributor returns processing event, Worker 1 shuttles between Large Shelf 2 and Area 2 to rapidly unpack, sort, and re-stage mixed returned goods for redistribution, periodically using Area 3 and main corridor waypoints (E8, F7, G4) for overflow due to staging saturation. Worker 2 simultaneously inspects, triages, and relays repacked items from Area 2, Area 3, and corridor staging to Area 1, Boxes 3, Shelf 1, or the Waste Area, frequently handling bulky items and sometimes pausing or leaving bins along the robot's fixed navigation route due to urgent multitasking and area congestion. The widely overlapping, dynamic workflows cause unpredictable corridor obstructions and intermittent blockages at core waypoints, forcing the autonomous robot to execute frequent, abrupt speed changes—braking and accelerating in response to the evolving environment—thereby substantially increasing its average jerk. All disruptions arise organically from legitimate operational pressures and live overflow management, without any direct human-robot interaction, making the scenario both operationally realistic and distinctly different from all preceding examples.",
