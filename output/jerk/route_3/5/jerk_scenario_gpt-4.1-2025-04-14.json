  "scenario": "In a peak-period cross-dock and outbound consolidation shift, Worker 1 rapidly transfers mixed inbound goods from Boxes 2 and 3 to Area 2 for pre-sorting, then forwards urgent items to Area 1 as shortfalls arise. Simultaneously, Worker 2 performs intensive outbound QC and completion in Area 1, repeatedly moving between Area 1, Shelf 1, and Area 2 to fetch, replace, and verify order components, while making irregular trips to the Waste Area for out-of-spec items. Both workers frequently occupy Area 1 and transit shared corridor waypoints (E9, E7, F7, G4) along the robot’s fixed A9–G4 route, often leaving carts or totes that unpredictably block navigation nodes due to operational interruptions or high order volume. The overlapping, uncoordinated, and time-sensitive nature of their workflows causes frequent, erratic obstructions at critical waypoints, requiring the robot to brake, pause, and accelerate in reaction to the constantly evolving environment—substantially increasing average jerk solely through legitimate warehouse pressures and dynamic human activity.",
