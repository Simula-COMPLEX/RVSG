  "scenario": "During a high-activity incoming shipment period, Worker 1 transports boxes from Regions 1 and 4 to Area 1 for initial sorting, using central pathways that align closely with the robot’s fixed delivery route from Shelf 1 (A9) to Area 1 (G4). Concurrently, Worker 2 performs quality control in Area 1, then repeatedly shuttles between Area 1 and Shelf 1 to restock, as well as to the Waste Area for rejected items. Both workers use and periodically pause at waypoints along the robot’s path, sometimes occupying corridor space with carts or staged boxes, resulting in frequent, unpredictable physical obstructions. The robot, operating autonomously, must constantly adjust its velocity—braking, accelerating, and occasionally making sharp course corrections—whenever worker activity or object placement temporarily blocks or unblocks its navigation grid points. This dense, overlapping workflow induces a significantly higher average jerk in the robot’s motion, with all disruptions arising naturally from legitimate operational pressures and dynamic human movements within the shared workspace.",
