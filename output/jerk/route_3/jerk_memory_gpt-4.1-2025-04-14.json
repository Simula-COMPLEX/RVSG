    "summary": "During a high-activity incoming shipment period, Worker 1 transports boxes from Regions 1 and 4 to Area 1 for initial sorting, using central pathways that align closely with the robot’s fixed delivery route from Shelf 1 (A9) to Area 1 (G4). Concurrently, Worker 2 performs quality control in Area 1, then repeatedly shuttles between Area 1 and Shelf 1 to restock, as well as to the Waste Area for rejected items. Both workers use and periodically pause at waypoints along the robot’s path, sometimes occupying corridor space with carts or staged boxes, resulting in frequent, unpredictable physical obstructions. The robot, operating autonomously, must constantly adjust its velocity—braking, accelerating, and occasionally making sharp course corrections—whenever worker activity or object placement temporarily blocks or unblocks its navigation grid points. This dense, overlapping workflow induces a significantly higher average jerk in the robot’s motion, with all disruptions arising naturally from legitimate operational pressures and dynamic human movements within the shared workspace.",

Worker 2, as an inspector, stages items received from Worker 1 in both Area 1 and Area 2, expanding into corridor space when overwhelmed. Both workers periodically cross paths or temporarily leave transport carts, checked items, or inspection containers along the robot's fixed route (A9→G4), particularly at high-traffic navigation points (E9, E8, E7, F7), creating intermittent and unpredictable physical obstructions. The robot must continually decelerate, stop, or accelerate in response to these natural workflow-driven disruptions, causing a substantially higher average jerk.

Simultaneously, Worker 2 handles exception items originating in Area 1, transporting them to the Waste Area or returning salvageable goods to Shelf 1, repeatedly shuttling across the same corridor with a returns cart and re-sorting materials at critical path points (E9, F7). Both workers’ workflows naturally overlap at high frequency in spatially constrained segments, with intermittent stationing, pausing, or cart placement unpredictably obstructing the robot’s navigation lane. The robot, autonomously navigating and reacting solely to real-time changes in its environment, must frequently alter its speed—braking, accelerating, or executing sudden maneuvers—whenever workers or their materials temporarily block or clear its valid waypoints. This dense, unscheduled overlap of legitimate order processing and urgent exception handling leads to a consistently elevated average jerk in the robot’s movement profile, with every disruption emerging organically from real operational pressures and workflow congestion.",

Worker 2 independently performs cycle counts with a bulky scanning cart, alternating between scanning and verifying items at Shelf 1 (A9), Boxes 2 (C5), Large Shelf 3 (L13), and Area 1 (G4), often pausing or depositing scanning bins at corridor-adjacent nodes (E9, F7, G4). Both workers unpredictably and repeatedly occupy or temporarily block the robot’s fixed A9–G4 route with carts or bins due to operational bottlenecks, audit interruptions, or partial staging, causing frequent and abrupt robot velocity changes.

The overlapping, high-frequency activity in shared zones, especially around Area 3 and along connecting corridors, leads to frequent, unpredictable obstruction and congestion at key robot waypoints. As both workers alternate between similar task phases, pause in corridor zones, and dynamically redirect movements in response to workflow batching, the robot, restricted to its fixed route, must continually adjust its speed and heading in response to newly blocked or cleared waypoints, naturally resulting in higher average jerk solely due to these evolving, operationally-realistic environmental disruptions.",
