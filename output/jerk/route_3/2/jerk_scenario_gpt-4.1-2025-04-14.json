  "scenario": "During a late-day peak outbound shipment rush, Worker 1 retrieves and stages outgoing batches from Shelf 1–3 to Area 1, frequently placing packing totes and supplies in, or adjacent to, the main corridor connecting Shelf 1 to Area 1 and temporarily occupying key waypoints along the robot’s fixed route (A9 to G4). Simultaneously, Worker 2 handles exception items originating in Area 1, transporting them to the Waste Area or returning salvageable goods to Shelf 1, repeatedly shuttling across the same corridor with a returns cart and re-sorting materials at critical path points (E9, F7). Both workers’ workflows naturally overlap at high frequency in spatially constrained segments, with intermittent stationing, pausing, or cart placement unpredictably obstructing the robot’s navigation lane. The robot, autonomously navigating and reacting solely to real-time changes in its environment, must frequently alter its speed—braking, accelerating, or executing sudden maneuvers—whenever workers or their materials temporarily block or clear its valid waypoints. This dense, unscheduled overlap of legitimate order processing and urgent exception handling leads to a consistently elevated average jerk in the robot’s movement profile, with every disruption emerging organically from real operational pressures and workflow congestion.",
