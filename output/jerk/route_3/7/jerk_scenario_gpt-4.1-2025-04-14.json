  "scenario": "During a large-scale product recall coinciding with an unexpected surge in inbound bulk shipments, Worker 1 rapidly retrieves and sorts recall items from Shelf 1 and the Waste Area, transporting them through central corridors to Area 1 for inspection, and dynamically staging overflow at F6/F5/G5 or Area 4 as space requires. Worker 2 concurrently receives oversized incoming shipments at Large Shelf 4 and Area 5, shuttling bulks up the main corridor and staging them at the nearest available corridor-adjacent points (J7/K7, E8/F7, or into Area 1/2 when urgent), while also relocating processed recall totes from the central corridor to long-term storage. Both workers frequently overlap at unpredictable corridor nodes (E9, E8, F7, G4), pausing, staging, or transferring bulky items in ways that organically and variably obstruct the robot’s fixed path from A9 to G4. All disruptions arise purely from legitimate, overlapping operational needs—bulk overflow, dynamic recall handling, and staging congestion—forcing the robot to brake, accelerate, or reroute frequently in response to evolving environmental blockages, and thus inducing a consistently high average jerk in robot motion despite the absence of any direct human-robot interaction.",
