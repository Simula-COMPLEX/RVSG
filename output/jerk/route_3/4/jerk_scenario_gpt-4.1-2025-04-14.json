  "scenario": "During a simultaneous spike in customer returns and a warehouse emergency restocking event, Worker 1 manages and sorts incoming returns by transferring them from Large Shelf 1 to Area 3, inspecting, then reallocating acceptable items to Shelf 2 via central pathways while discarding damaged goods to the Waste Area. Concurrently, Worker 2 addresses an urgent restocking alert, collecting processed items from both Area 3 (where Worker 1 is still active) and Area 1 for immediate placement on Shelves 5 and 6, repeatedly traversing the same corridor and staging packing totes and relabeling supplies near the main robot path (E9, F9, G4). The overlapping, high-frequency activity in shared zones, especially around Area 3 and along connecting corridors, leads to frequent, unpredictable obstruction and congestion at key robot waypoints. As both workers alternate between similar task phases, pause in corridor zones, and dynamically redirect movements in response to workflow batching, the robot, restricted to its fixed route, must continually adjust its speed and heading in response to newly blocked or cleared waypoints, naturally resulting in higher average jerk solely due to these evolving, operationally-realistic environmental disruptions.",
