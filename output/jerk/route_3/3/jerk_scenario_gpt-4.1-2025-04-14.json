  "scenario": "During a simultaneous high-mix order kitting and randomized cycle count audit, Worker 1 assembles kits by repeatedly gathering items from Shelf 1, Boxes 2, and Large Shelf 2, using Area 2 as a kitting base and frequently staging partially completed kits or carts at waypoints in the central corridor (E9–G4) when facing congestion. Worker 2 independently performs cycle counts with a bulky scanning cart, alternating between scanning and verifying items at Shelf 1 (A9), Boxes 2 (C5), Large Shelf 3 (L13), and Area 1 (G4), often pausing or depositing scanning bins at corridor-adjacent nodes (E9, F7, G4). Both workers unpredictably and repeatedly occupy or temporarily block the robot’s fixed A9–G4 route with carts or bins due to operational bottlenecks, audit interruptions, or partial staging, causing frequent and abrupt robot velocity changes. All human actions are legitimate workflow responses to real kitting and audit demands. The robot's navigation is disrupted solely by these evolving environmental factors, resulting in a substantially increased average jerk without any intentional interference or direct human-robot communication.",
