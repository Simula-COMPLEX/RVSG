  "scenario": "During an intensive inventory consolidation and audit exception fast-track, Worker 1 retrieves mismatched stock items from Boxes 1–3 (Region 1) and Large Shelves 2–3 (Region 4), consolidating them into Shelf 1 (Region 2), often staging containers or pausing for count checks in main corridor waypoints (E7/E8/E9) and near Area 1 (G4) as audit surges and overflow occur. Simultaneously, Worker 2 handles a stream of urgent exception items and returns, shuttling between Area 5, Shelf 1, and the Waste Area, repeatedly pausing at or staging materials in central corridor waypoints (especially E8/E9 and F8/F7) and Area 1 when urgent inspections or backlog arise. Both workers frequently cross paths, pause, stage, or move bulky bins and carts along the robot’s fixed path (A9–G4), with their overlapping, non-linear audit and exception workflows causing dynamic, unpredictable blockages at key navigation points. The autonomous robot, which reacts solely to environmental changes, is forced to rapidly brake, accelerate, or pause in response to new or cleared obstructions, resulting in a consistently high average jerk purely due to authentic consolidation surges and audit pressures in the real-world workspace.",
