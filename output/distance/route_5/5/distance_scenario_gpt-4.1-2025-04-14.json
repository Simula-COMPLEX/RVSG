  "scenario": "At the end of a high-activity shipping period, two workers are assigned to remove surplus packaging and returnable equipment from Areas 2 and 5, preparing the floor for the next shift. Worker 1 continuously sweeps from Area 5 to the Waste Area, collecting loose packaging and stacking reusable bins at Area 1, moving directly along the robot’s fixed G19→G3 path. Worker 2 simultaneously works as a cleanser and cross-checker, starting at Area 2 and progressing to Area 1 and Waste Area, then backtracking left-to-right across the same G-row to ensure all debris is cleared and organizing any newly found surplus. Both workers repeatedly traverse the robot’s route, pausing and collaborating as needed at staging points, resulting in sustained, high-density co-location along nearly every point of the robot’s corridor. This ‘reset and redistribution’ cycle—emerging from realistic end-of-shift clean-up demands—ensures the smallest possible average distance between the robot and both workers, as human workflow and robot movement are nearly always concurrently and tightly aligned in both space and task sequence.",
