  "scenario": "In a time-sensitive bulk returns and partial restock operation, two workers are assigned to handle a flood of inbound returned goods arriving at Area 5. Worker 1 inspects returns at Area 5, rapidly shuttling restockable items to Areas 1 or 2, and staging waste in sub-piles along Row G (G12, G9, G6) for later collection. Worker 2 alternates between collecting staged waste from Row G points (G12, G9, G6) to the Waste Area (G3), and moving restockable items from Areas 1/2 to Region 2 shelves for inventory return, traversing and working directly on the robot's fixed path (G19 to G3). Both workers operate independently and at high frequency in opposite and overlapping directions, with frequent pauses and handoffs at locations precisely on or adjacent to the robot route. This workflow creates persistent, dense worker presence along the robot’s course, ensuring the smallest possible average distance between the robot and the workers—arising solely from realistic, intense reverse logistics and restocking operations under space and time constraints.",
