  "scenario": "Amid a sudden emergency recall triggered by suspected contamination in outbound stock, two workers jointly execute a real-time defect diagnosis and removal operation. Both alternate between inspecting goods in Area 5 and shuttling contaminated items leftward along Row G to the Waste Area (G3–G4) for immediate disposal, or cleared items rightward/upward to Shelf 1 (D–E, 10–11) for quarantine. At each cycle, both independently—and without communication—move repeatedly along and across the robot’s fixed G19→G3 route, staging intermittent sub-piles at G11 and G6 for batch sorting. Their tasks involve dense, rapid, and mutually overlapping movement along Row G as they diagnose, sort, and transport items per recall procedures. This intense activity ensures both workers are nearly always present on or immediately adjacent to the robot’s path, leading to minimal average distance between the robot and both workers through naturally converging, high-urgency recall workflows driven solely by emergent environmental needs, not by deliberate positioning.",
