  "scenario": "During a high-urgency inbound cross-docking and mixed-pallet split-sort operation, two workers must jointly process, sort, and redistribute a flood of mixed inbound goods arriving at Area 5. Worker 1 stages and unpacks mixed pallets at Area 5, feeding unpacked items down Row G (G19→G3), dynamically sorting restockable and waste items along the robot's fixed route. Worker 2 simultaneously follows and intercepts along Row G, rapidly classifying, collecting, and either transferring wastes to the Waste Area (G3) or shuttling restockables to Areas 1/2. The sorting and hand-off process forces both workers to physically occupy nearly the entire length of the robot’s path, frequently overlapping in location and timing with each other and the robot. The combined effect of continuous item movement, rapid split-sorting, collection, and frequent backtracking keeps the average distance between the robot and both workers at a minimum, as a natural outcome of high-intensity, real-world warehouse surge processing workflows.",
