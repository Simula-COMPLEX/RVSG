  "scenario": "At the end of a shift plagued by misallocated and misclassified goods, two workers perform an urgent reverse logistics and inventory rescue audit. Worker 1 starts in Area 5, sorting all items and carrying potentially misallocated stock along Row G, pausing at intermediate sub-piles (G15, G11, G7) and ending at the Waste Area (G3) for final checks, then returning with salvageable items to Areas 1/2 or Area 5. Worker 2 begins at the Waste Area (G3), auditing waste and walking up Row G to Area 5, checking all sub-piles for possible inventory errors and retrieving stock for restaging. Both workers crisscross the robot's fixed G19→G3 path in repeated, independent audit and rescue sweeps, pausing and meeting at shared intermediate points. This nuanced, distributed workflow maximizes their average proximity to the robot throughout its operation—since both are compelled by the real audit and error recovery process to repeatedly occupy, pause, and traverse almost the entire length of the robot’s fixed route.",
