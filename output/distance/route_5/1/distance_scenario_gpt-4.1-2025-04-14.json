  "scenario": "During a critical pre-dispatch inventory consolidation and reconciliation window, two workers are simultaneously assigned to clear, stage, re-sort, and pack loose or misplaced items from across Areas 1, 2, and 5. Worker 1 systematically sweeps Areas 1 and 2 for stray or overflow items, consolidating them at Area 5 along Row G. Worker 2 packs eligible items from Area 5 for immediate outbound, shuttling packed goods toward the dispatch edge and returning overstock or disqualified items to Area 2 or the Waste Area. Both workers frequently traverse Row G—Worker 1 moving between Areas 1/2 and Area 5, Worker 2 ferrying goods from Area 5 across Row G to Area 2 and the Waste Area—repeatedly overlapping with the robot’s fixed path as it autonomously transports a waste item from G19 to G3. Overlapping staging, sorting, packing, and returns create dense, persistent worker presence along the whole robot route, minimizing average distance between the robot and both workers via naturally synchronous, high-traffic operational flows.",
