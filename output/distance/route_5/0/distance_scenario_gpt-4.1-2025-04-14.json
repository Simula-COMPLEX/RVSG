  "scenario": "During an urgent product recall and waste-disposal surge, two workers are assigned to jointly clear defective stock from Large Shelf 4 and Area 5, inspecting items and discarding rejects in the Waste Area. Worker 1 continuously stages and delivers failed items from Area 5 toward the Waste Area along the G-row, while Worker 2 inspects items in Area 5 and, as needed, accompanies or independently transports failed items to the Waste Area, leading both workers to move repeatedly, side by side or staggered, along the robot's fixed route from G19 to G3. Overlapping inspection, discarding, and frequent handoff cycles ensure both workers remain spatially close to the robot as it autonomously transfers an item from Area 5 to the Waste Area. This surge-driven, high-activity workflow organically maximizes worker presence along the robot's route, yielding the smallest possible average distance between the robot and both workers during task execution.",
