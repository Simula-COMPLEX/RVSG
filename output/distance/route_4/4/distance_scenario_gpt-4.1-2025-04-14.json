  "scenario": "During a surprise afternoon quality control audit and urgent repackaging cycle, both human workers are required to simultaneously retrieve and inspect products from Large Shelf 1 and multiple standard Shelves, using Area 2 and Area 4 as dynamic audit/repack staging zones. Worker 1 repeatedly pulls bulk items from Large Shelf 1 (M5–L7), transporting them to Area 2 (I12–I14) or Area 4 (H17) for inspection and rapid repackaging, and frequently commutes between these zones for cross-checks and workflow maintenance. Worker 2 concurrently audits and relocates parcels between Shelf 3/4, Area 2, and Area 4, performing real-time spot checks, taking defect items to the Waste Area, or staging pass items in Area 5. Both workers cycle repeatedly along the major aisle corridor (L6–K11–I14–H17), with frequent overlap at Area 2 and Area 4, often working side by side or converging at identical or adjacent waypoints. The robot, tasked with autonomously moving bulk repack stock from Large Shelf 1 to Area 4, traverses the same high-congestion corridor, resulting in it being almost constantly near one or both workers. The substantial spatial and timing overlap, driven by urgent quality workflow and intensive use of shared central corridors, results in the robot’s average distance to the closest worker being minimized naturally and persistently throughout its route.",
