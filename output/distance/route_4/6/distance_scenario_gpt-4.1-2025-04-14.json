  "scenario": "During an emergency hazardous material segregating operation, two human workers are redeployed to contain and relocate potentially contaminated stock discovered on Large Shelf 1 and Large Shelf 2. Worker 1 rapidly removes suspect items from Large Shelf 1/2, transporting them northward along the main aisle to Area 4 (H17) for quarantine, documentation, and packing, then detours to Area 2 for containment supplies before returning south. Worker 2 continually shuttles between Area 4 (H17) and the Waste Area (F2–G4), repeatedly transporting cleared/safe items via the central corridor, and periodically returns east through Area 3 and Area 2 for new packing materials or overflow handling. Both workers converge, overlap, and parallel the robot's fixed material transport route (M5 to H17) for nearly the entire journey; high-volume, urgent workflow and shared utilization of aisle and staging space result in both workers, often side-by-side, tracing the robot’s course—especially within K9–K11–J13–I14–H17. The robot, unaffected by direct commands, is brought into constant, minimal-distance proximity with the humans purely via emergent operational overlap, environmental congestion, and shared process cycles throughout the critical incident response cycle.",
