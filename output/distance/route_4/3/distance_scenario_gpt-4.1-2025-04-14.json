  "scenario": "During an intense late-afternoon cross-docking and just-in-time fulfillment window, Worker 1 continuously transfers bulk restock items from Large Shelf 1 to Area 3 for pre-sorting, then from Area 3 to Area 4 for staging, repeatedly mirroring the robot’s path from M5 to H17 along the main horizontal and vertical corridors. Meanwhile, Worker 2 circulates between Shelf 5/6, the Waste Area, Area 5, and Area 4, replenishing packaging materials, sorting urgent orders, and consolidating dispatch, often traversing the robot’s final and central path segments (I14–H17) and causing recurrent overlap at Area 4. The constant, high-density movement through shared corridors, mutual staging at Area 4, and ongoing item transfer result in the robot’s route being consistently and densely occupied by both workers, ensuring the smallest possible average distance between the robot and humans is achieved solely via realistic convergence of work cycles, operational crossovers, and environmental congestion.",
