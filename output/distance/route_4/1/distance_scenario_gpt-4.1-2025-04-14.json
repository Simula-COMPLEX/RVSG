  "scenario": "During a scheduled inventory cycle count and discrepancy resolution period, Worker 1 is tasked with auditing shelves in Region 2 (Shelf 1–6), repeatedly transporting flagged or miscounted items to Area 4 (H17) for secondary inspection and then returning verified items. Meanwhile, Worker 2 handles bulk packages in Region 1 (Boxes 1–3), frequently transferring items to Area 4 (H17) for staging and cross-verification prior to dispatch or reallocation. Periodically, both workers convene in Area 4 to jointly resolve discrepancies, resulting in overlapping activities and shared movement corridors almost entirely tracing the robot’s fixed route (M5 → H17 and back). This operational flow naturally keeps both workers in close proximity to the robot’s path for extended durations, leading to the smallest possible average distance to the robot, driven by overlapping transport cycles, central staging, and repeated convergence at key processing zones.",
