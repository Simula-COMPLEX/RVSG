  "scenario": "During a high-urgency, just-in-time assembly kitting and replenishment cycle, Worker 1 is responsible for repeatedly picking urgent parts and bulk items from Large Shelf 1, transporting them north along the main central corridor to Area 2 for rapid interim sorting and kit assembly, and then shuttling partial or completed kits to Area 4 for immediate dispatch or further processing. Simultaneously, Worker 2 operates in a line-side coordinating role—cycling between Area 4 and Area 5 for late-stage kit review, then moving incomplete kits or components back to Area 2 or Large Shelf 1 via the same main aisle if shortages or errors are discovered, and then returning along these shared routes after supplementation. Both workers move frequently and dynamically along the robot’s fixed path (M5 to H17), often crossing, leapfrogging, or working in near-identical aisles as operational demands force serial and parallel usage of both Area 2 and Area 4 for processing. The high-frequency, bi-directional, and parallel flows—driven by volatile assembly requirements—result in the robot nearly always being in close proximity to at least one worker along every zone of its journey, yielding the smallest possible average distance to humans through naturally emergent congestion, overlap, and repeated convergence across the warehouse core.",
