  "scenario": "During an end-of-day bulk consolidation and redistribution cycle, two human workers are assigned distinct, yet closely interwoven roles that require them to traverse, occupy, and repeatedly return to the same warehouse corridors and central operational areas as the robot’s fixed route (from M5 at Large Shelf 1 to H17 at Area 4). Worker 1 cycles continuously between Large Shelf 1, Area 2, and Area 4, transporting bulk items for sorting and staging, precisely mirroring the robot’s horizontal and vertical travel path. Worker 2 simultaneously clears overflow from Area 5 to Area 4 and, as space constraints demand, shuttles between Area 4, Area 3, and Area 5, repeatedly crossing or sharing the final segments of the robot’s trajectory. High processing volume forces both workers to coordinate their movement and activities directly along the robot’s route: Worker 1 and Worker 2 frequently converge side-by-side or alternate leapfrogging in central aisles and Area 4, resulting in almost constant human presence along all major waypoints of the robot’s journey. The workflow is driven purely by operational necessity—minimizing the average distance between the robot and the workers naturally, through repeated high-density use of identical or adjacent paths and shared staging zones, with no direct interaction or coordination between humans and the autonomous robot.",
