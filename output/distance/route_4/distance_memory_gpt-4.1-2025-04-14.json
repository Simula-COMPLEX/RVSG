    "summary": "During a peak morning receiving operation, two human workers are jointly responsible for unloading bulk stock from Large Shelf 1, transporting it along the main warehouse aisle to Area 4, and collaboratively performing rapid sorting and initial inspection tasks in Area 4. Both frequently walk the full pathway between Large Shelf 1 (M5–L7) and Area 4 (H17), retracing the robot's fixed navigation route almost entirely. Overflow or defective items are regularly moved together to Area 5, further increasing the overlap along H16–H17. As a result, both workers spend extended periods in close proximity to the robot as it travels between M5 and H17, resulting in the smallest possible average distance between the robot and the workers based on naturally occurring workflow, overlapping task zones, and repeated back-and-forth movement along shared corridors.",

Meanwhile, Worker 2 handles bulk packages in Region 1 (Boxes 1–3), frequently transferring items to Area 4 (H17) for staging and cross-verification prior to dispatch or reallocation. Periodically, both workers convene in Area 4 to jointly resolve discrepancies, resulting in overlapping activities and shared movement corridors almost entirely tracing the robot’s fixed route (M5 → H17 and back). This operational flow naturally keeps both workers in close proximity to the robot’s path for extended durations, leading to the smallest possible average distance to the robot, driven by overlapping transport cycles, central staging, and repeated convergence at key processing zones.",

The cyclical, staggered but converging tasks in Area 4, frequent batch handoffs, and high south-to-north and east-to-west movement cycles result in the robot traveling in extremely close proximity to at least one worker for almost its entire route, minimizing the average human-robot distance due to sustained operational congestion and spatial convergence within required workflow zones.",

Both workers cycle repeatedly along the major aisle corridor (L6–K11–I14–H17), with frequent overlap at Area 2 and Area 4, often working side by side or converging at identical or adjacent waypoints. The robot, tasked with autonomously moving bulk repack stock from Large Shelf 1 to Area 4, traverses the same high-congestion corridor, resulting in it being almost constantly near one or both workers. The substantial spatial and timing overlap, driven by urgent quality workflow and intensive use of shared central corridors, results in the robot’s average distance to the closest worker being minimized naturally and persistently throughout its route.",

Worker 1 cycles continuously between Large Shelf 1, Area 2, and Area 4, transporting bulk items for sorting and staging, precisely mirroring the robot’s horizontal and vertical travel path. Worker 2 simultaneously clears overflow from Area 5 to Area 4 and, as space constraints demand, shuttles between Area 4, Area 3, and Area 5, repeatedly crossing or sharing the final segments of the robot’s trajectory. High processing volume forces both workers to coordinate their movement and activities directly along the robot’s route: Worker 1 and Worker 2 frequently converge side-by-side or alternate leapfrogging in central aisles and Area 4, resulting in almost constant human presence along all major waypoints of the robot’s journey. The workflow is driven purely by operational necessity—minimizing the average distance between the robot and the workers naturally, through repeated high-density use of identical or adjacent paths and shared staging zones, with no direct interaction or coordination between humans and the autonomous robot.",

Both workers converge, overlap, and parallel the robot's fixed material transport route (M5 to H17) for nearly the entire journey; high-volume, urgent workflow and shared utilization of aisle and staging space result in both workers, often side-by-side, tracing the robot’s course—especially within K9–K11–J13–I14–H17.
