  "scenario": "During a peak morning receiving operation, two human workers are jointly responsible for unloading bulk stock from Large Shelf 1, transporting it along the main warehouse aisle to Area 4, and collaboratively performing rapid sorting and initial inspection tasks in Area 4. Both frequently walk the full pathway between Large Shelf 1 (M5–L7) and Area 4 (H17), retracing the robot's fixed navigation route almost entirely. Overflow or defective items are regularly moved together to Area 5, further increasing the overlap along H16–H17. As a result, both workers spend extended periods in close proximity to the robot as it travels between M5 and H17, resulting in the smallest possible average distance between the robot and the workers based on naturally occurring workflow, overlapping task zones, and repeated back-and-forth movement along shared corridors.",
