  "scenario": "During a high-volume dispatch preparation overlapping a rolling inventory spot audit, Worker 1 continuously cycles between Large Shelf 1 and Area 4, picking and consolidating urgent outbound dispatch orders, while repeatedly retrieving smaller items from Boxes 2 in Region 1 and returning to Area 4 for staging and packing. At the same time, Worker 2 performs a cross-inventory audit, starting at Area 4, descending to Large Shelf 1 for stock checks and replenishment, then periodically traveling to Area 5 for restock containers before returning to Area 4 for updates and further transfers to Boxes 3. Both workers traverse the same central aisle corridors as the robot’s fixed path (M5 to H17), frequently clustering at Area 4 for processing, sorting, and paperwork. This scenario naturally results in both workers repeatedly operating in immediate proximity to the robot for extended durations, with their converging, cyclical workflows and shared pathway usage minimizing the average human-robot distance solely via legitimate operational demands and emergent high-density occupancy of the core movement corridor—never due to any direct coordination or intentional positioning relative to the robot.",
