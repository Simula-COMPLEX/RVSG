  "scenario": "During a midday expedited returns reprocessing cycle, Worker 1 repeatedly collects batches of returned items from Large Shelf 2 and Large Shelf 3 (L9–M15), carrying them north through the main warehouse corridor to Area 4 (H17) for detailed inspection and eligibility staging. Worker 2 alternates between Area 4, where relabeling and documentation are performed, and the Shelf 4–6 segment in Region 2 (C16–E22), where approved items are immediately restocked. Both use Area 4 as a central staging/processing hub and often operate in close proximity within its adjacent corridors. The robot, carrying items from Large Shelf 1 (M5) along its fixed path to Area 4 (H17), shares nearly the entire southern and central route corridor with Worker 1, and overlaps frequently at H17 with Worker 2. The cyclical, staggered but converging tasks in Area 4, frequent batch handoffs, and high south-to-north and east-to-west movement cycles result in the robot traveling in extremely close proximity to at least one worker for almost its entire route, minimizing the average human-robot distance due to sustained operational congestion and spatial convergence within required workflow zones.",
