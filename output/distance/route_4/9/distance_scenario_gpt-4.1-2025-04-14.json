  "scenario": "During an urgent mixed-SKU assembly and replenishment surge, Worker 1 collects batches from Large Shelf 1 and Large Shelf 3, repeatedly transiting along the central corridor (M5–L9–K9–J13–I15) to Area 3 for interim kit assembly, then delivers completed kits to Area 4 (H17) for outbound staging. Simultaneously, Worker 2 retrieves short-picked or error order components from Boxes 2 and Shelf 2, transporting them first to Area 2, then often joining Worker 1 in Area 3 for real-time correction or supplementation, before delivering all items together to Area 4. The process requires both workers to frequently and independently travel nearly the robot’s entire fixed route, then work side-by-side in Area 3 and Area 4 for extended periods, maximizing overlap with the robot’s position. Their naturally interleaved, spatially and temporally dense operational cycles—driven by legitimate workflow and emergent surge demands—yield the smallest possible average robot-to-human distance throughout the material transport operation, enabled solely by dynamic, repeated mutual occupancy of core corridors and central staging areas.",
