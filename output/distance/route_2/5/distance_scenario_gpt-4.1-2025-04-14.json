  "scenario": "During a dual-mode warehouse operation, one worker executes rapid cross-docking of inbound items from Large Shelf 4 to Area 3 for staging, then immediately transfers sorted goods to Shelf 2 and Shelf 3 using the robot’s full corridor route (M21 → E14). Meanwhile, a second worker retrieves defective goods from Shelf 2 and Shelf 3, transports them to Area 2 for rework, and subsequently merges repaired items into Area 3 alongside new incomings. The two workers’ roles are operationally distinct but mutually dependent, repeatedly causing both to converge on, traverse, and share all key choke points—the entire robot path, with extreme focus at Area 3 and the shelving corridor. Their independent yet tightly interlocked activities require constant shuttling, concurrent staging, handoffs, and resource sharing on the exact corridor used by the robot, ensuring the smallest possible average distance between the robot and human workers as an authentic outcome of live cross-docking, defect rework, and buffer integration.",
