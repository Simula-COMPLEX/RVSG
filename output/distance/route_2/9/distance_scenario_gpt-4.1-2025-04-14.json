  "scenario": "Facing a sudden large-scale bin error and inventory misplacement event, the warehouse triggers a dynamic, live rebalancing and item-level repair operation. Worker 1 starts at Shelves 2 and 3 (E14 area), extracting misplaced or problem goods, moving down the robot’s fixed corridor toward Large Shelf 4 (M21), but stopping at Areas 3 and 4 to instantly check and fix faults en route. Repaired or relabeled items go on to Large Shelf 4, while unsorted ones loop through the buffer until corrected. Worker 2 begins at Large Shelf 4, transferring repaired or ready stock back up the corridor to Shelves 2 and 3, stopping at mid-corridor buffers for quick quality insertions and label checks. Both frequently return along the corridor after completing micro-tasks, causing dense, bidirectional, item-by-item convergence and congestion along every major waypoint and especially at bottlenecks (Areas 3/4). The robot, following its fixed M21→E14 path, continuously finds one or both workers immediately ahead, behind, or beside it—at random intervals due to genuine, unsynchronized inventory task flows—ensuring minimized average distance to the nearest person as a true consequence of urgent, high-activity, real-world stock and condition adjustment demands.",
