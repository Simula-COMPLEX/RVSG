  "scenario": "During a high-turnover outbound operation with double quality control, Worker 1 performs rapid, repeated picking runs from Large Shelf 4 to Area 4 for order staging, while Worker 2 conducts quality checks at Area 4 and immediately relocates passed items to Shelf 2 or Shelf 3. Items failing audit are redirected by Worker 2 to Area 2 or back to Large Shelf 4. Both workers thus continuously traverse and re-traverse the core corridor—the exact route taken by the robot—as they pick, stage, inspect, and shuttle items between operational and storage zones. All movement arises from workflow necessity: dual handling, audit-and-repair cycles, and batch staging. This results in frequent, often simultaneous presence of both workers on or directly beside the robot’s fixed transport path from M21 to E14, yielding the smallest possible average robot-to-human distance by maximizing shared, overlapping activity within the robot’s navigation corridor, fully driven by the operational demands of complex outbound fulfillment and quality control.",
