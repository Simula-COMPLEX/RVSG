  "scenario": "During an urgent, compliance-driven expiry stock rotation, Worker 1 systematically removes soon-to-expire products from Large Shelf 4 (starting near M21), delivering them via the main central corridor (M21–E14) to Shelf 2 and Shelf 3 for fast-track outbound batching, and staging any items already past expiry at Area 2 for QA before transporting them to the Waste Area. Meanwhile, Worker 2, tasked with assembling outbound orders under FIFO/expiry batching rules, continuously shuttles between Shelf 2/3 (E14 area), Areas 4 and 5 (for staging and QA), and Area 2 whenever further QA/triage is required, using exactly the same corridor as the robot’s fixed route. Due to the time-critical nature of compliance and outbound shipping, both workers independently and repeatedly traverse, occupy, or work directly adjacent to the robot’s entire path (including at bottlenecks like Shelf 2/3, Area 2, and staging areas). All movement and proximity arises solely from legitimate expiry management and outbound workflow needs, which, due to process design and layout, reliably minimize the robot’s average distance to the closest worker throughout execution.",
