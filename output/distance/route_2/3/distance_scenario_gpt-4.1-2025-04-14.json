  "scenario": "During a surge in reverse logistics and damage returns processing, Worker 1 frequently shuttles returned and damaged goods from Large Shelf 4 to Area 1 for inspection, using the core warehouse corridor that precisely matches the robot’s fixed route (M21–E14). Worker 2 inspects items at Area 1, then rapidly alternates between moving restockable items to Shelf 2 or Shelf 3 (via E14/F14/F15) and transferring waste items to the Waste Area, both via pathways that directly overlap with or abut the robot’s waypoints. Intense, high-volume staging creates near-constant movement and physical overlap between the two workers in the main transport lanes, especially at Area 1 and adjacent shelves. This operational necessity—real-time triage, shared use of bottleneck areas, and parallel transport—results in the robot almost always traveling in close proximity to one or both workers, yielding a minimal average distance to the nearest human throughout its task. All proximity arises naturally as a consequence of the stepwise, high-intensity triage and restock workflow, without intentional positioning.",
