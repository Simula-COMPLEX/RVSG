  "scenario": "During an intensive biannual inventory count and live condition audit, two workers are assigned to physically audit all shelves and operational buffer areas along the robot's fixed route from M21 to E14. Worker 1 starts at Large Shelf 4 and audits all even-numbered shelves and adjacent areas northbound, immediately returning to Large Shelf 4 to restock any missing or damaged items and retracing their steps as needed. Worker 2 starts at Shelf 1, audits all odd-numbered shelves and buffer zones southbound, also retrieving all necessary restock materials from Large Shelf 4 whenever discrepancies are detected. Both workers crisscross the same robot corridor (M21–E14) multiple times, often in parallel, repeatedly passing each other and the robot as shelf errors, miscounts, or inventory damage force frequent, unpredictable returns to the large shelf. Audits, checks, and restocks are unsynchronized, causing dense, random overlapping activity along the robot's path. This constant movement in, out of, and along the robot’s entire route ensures that, throughout the operation, the robot maintains a minimum average distance from both workers, with much of its journey occurring within arm’s reach of at least one human. All proximity and environmental influences on the robot result solely from legitimate stock audit, retrieval, and restocking process requirements.",
