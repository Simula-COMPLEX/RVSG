  "scenario": "In a peak-period warehouse cycle, two workers perform a combined replenishment and inbound sorting operation. Both workers alternate and share tasks of sorting newly arrived items placed on Large Shelf 4 and Area 5. They shuttle inventory along the robot's fixed route from M21 to E14, performing concurrent sorting and replenishing on Shelf 2 and Shelf 3. Their natural workflows require frequent, overlapping movement between Large Shelf 4, Area 5, and the shelving corridor (E14), repeatedly passing along the robot’s route. This results in both workers frequently occupying or crossing the robot’s path during its transport, minimizing the average distance between robot and workers due to dense, shared activity within the route’s corridor. All movement arises directly from legitimate workflow needs—receiving, sorting, quality-checking, and replenishing—resulting in constant, close proximity between the robot and the two workers without any intentional interference.",
