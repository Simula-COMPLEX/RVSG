    "summary": "In a peak-period warehouse cycle, two workers perform a combined replenishment and inbound sorting operation. Both workers alternate and share tasks of sorting newly arrived items placed on Large Shelf 4 and Area 5. They shuttle inventory along the robot's fixed route from M21 to E14, performing concurrent sorting and replenishing on Shelf 2 and Shelf 3. Their natural workflows require frequent, overlapping movement between Large Shelf 4, Area 5, and the shelving corridor (E14), repeatedly passing along the robot’s route. This results in both workers frequently occupying or crossing the robot’s path during its transport, minimizing the average distance between robot and workers due to dense, shared activity within the route’s corridor. All movement arises directly from legitimate workflow needs—receiving, sorting, quality-checking, and replenishing—resulting in constant, close proximity between the robot and the two workers without any intentional interference.",

Items failing audit are redirected by Worker 2 to Area 2 or back to Large Shelf 4. Both workers thus continuously traverse and re-traverse the core corridor—the exact route taken by the robot—as they pick, stage, inspect, and shuttle items between operational and storage zones.

This results in frequent, often simultaneous presence of both workers on or directly beside the robot’s fixed transport path from M21 to E14, yielding the smallest possible average robot-to-human distance by maximizing shared, overlapping activity within the robot’s navigation corridor, fully driven by the operational demands of complex outbound fulfillment and quality control.",

Worker 2 starts at Shelf 1, audits all odd-numbered shelves and buffer zones southbound, also retrieving all necessary restock materials from Large Shelf 4 whenever discrepancies are detected. Both workers crisscross the same robot corridor (M21–E14) multiple times, often in parallel, repeatedly passing each other and the robot as shelf errors, miscounts, or inventory damage force frequent, unpredictable returns to the large shelf. Audits, checks, and restocks are unsynchronized, causing dense, random overlapping activity along the robot's path. This constant movement in, out of, and along the robot’s entire route ensures that, throughout the operation, the robot maintains a minimum average distance from both workers, with much of its journey occurring within arm’s reach of at least one human.

Worker 2 inspects items at Area 1, then rapidly alternates between moving restockable items to Shelf 2 or Shelf 3 (via E14/F14/F15) and transferring waste items to the Waste Area, both via pathways that directly overlap with or abut the robot’s waypoints. Intense, high-volume staging creates near-constant movement and physical overlap between the two workers in the main transport lanes, especially at Area 1 and adjacent shelves. This operational necessity—real-time triage, shared use of bottleneck areas, and parallel transport—results in the robot almost always traveling in close proximity to one or both workers, yielding a minimal average distance to the nearest human throughout its task. All proximity arises naturally as a consequence of the stepwise, high-intensity triage and restock workflow, without intentional positioning.",

Their legitimate, urgent tasks require frequent stops and close movement on the robot’s route.

Meanwhile, Worker 2, tasked with assembling outbound orders under FIFO/expiry batching rules, continuously shuttles between Shelf 2/3 (E14 area), Areas 4 and 5 (for staging and QA), and Area 2 whenever further QA/triage is required, using exactly the same corridor as the robot’s fixed route. Due to the time-critical nature of compliance and outbound shipping, both workers independently and repeatedly traverse, occupy, or work directly adjacent to the robot’s entire path (including at bottlenecks like Shelf 2/3, Area 2, and staging areas).

Worker 1 receives mixed-return kits at Area 5, rapidly de-kitting and sorting components, regularly shuttling usable parts through staging zones (Areas 3 and 4) to both Large Shelf 4 (for bulk restock) and Shelf 2/3 (for high-turnover pieces), and moving defectives to waste. Simultaneously, Worker 2 retrieves bulk kit components from Large Shelf 4, temporarily stages or pre-assembles items alongside Worker 1 at Areas 2, 3, and 4, then moves kits to Shelf 2 or Shelf 3 for order fulfillment, constantly looping back for missing or swapped parts. The process demands frequent, unsynchronized crossing, parallel movement, and shared occupancy along the robot’s fixed route from M21 to E14—especially through the open buffer and inspection corridor. The necessity for repeated multi-point handoffs, overlapping staging, and component swaps, combined with high volume and tight timing, ensures both workers remain almost always in or near the exact corridor the robot traverses, producing minimal average distance between the robot and humans. This pattern arises entirely from normal, urgent warehouse kitting/returns operations with zero intentional positioning, and represents a fundamentally different, multi-stage, relay-and-overlap workflow from any previously described scenario.",
