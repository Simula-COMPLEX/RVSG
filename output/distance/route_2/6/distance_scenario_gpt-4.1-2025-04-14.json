  "scenario": "A simultaneous hazardous material segregation (HMS) event and high-frequency, urgent outbound batch staging forces two workers into closely overlapping activity along the robot’s fixed warehouse route (M21 to E14). Worker 1 repeatedly removes flagged hazardous goods from Large Shelf 4 and Area 5, conveying them to the Waste Area, but must frequently stage these in Area 2 when the Waste Area is briefly blocked. Worker 2 picks, groups, and re-audits outgoing items from Shelf 3, Area 4, and Area 5, returning to correct errors or replenish items via the same corridor, sometimes using Area 2 as overflow buffer. Both workers undertake independent, asynchronous shuttling, with frequent crossings, mutual delays, and shared use of Area 2, leading to dense human activity precisely along and adjacent to the robot’s navigation waypoints. Their legitimate, urgent tasks require frequent stops and close movement on the robot’s route. The robot, moving autonomously and reacting only to physical environmental changes, is almost always in minimal proximity to at least one worker due to persistent corridor congestion, shared buffer use, and high activity around the robot’s path.",
