  "scenario": "In parallel urgent cycle-counting and live dispatch prep, Worker 1 audits inventory from Large Shelf 4 up through all major storage and operational areas along the warehouse central corridor (M21 to E14), physically checking and instantly correcting any slotting errors, requiring repeated, bi-directional travel along and across the robot’s exact route. Worker 2 simultaneously assembles outgoing dispatches at Area 5, repeatedly moving up and down the same corridor to pick inventory from Large Shelf 4, operational zones, and Shelves 2 and 3, instantly retrieving, correcting, or re-picking items on-the-fly upon detecting shortages or pick errors. Both workers’ unsynchronized, urgent operations cause them to continuously occupy, traverse, and overlap within the robot’s navigation corridor, frequently crisscrossing, paralleling, or converging at exactly the waypoints traversed by the robot. All proximity arises directly from operational necessity—the need for live correction, urgent slotting, and synchronized staging—resulting in the robot maintaining the smallest possible average distance to the workers throughout its task, with persistent near-contact due to task-driven congestion and workflow overlap.",
