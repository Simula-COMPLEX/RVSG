  "scenario": "A dual-stage, high-intensity kitting and de-kitting surge forces two workers to engage in continuous, spatially intertwined workflows. Worker 1 receives mixed-return kits at Area 5, rapidly de-kitting and sorting components, regularly shuttling usable parts through staging zones (Areas 3 and 4) to both Large Shelf 4 (for bulk restock) and Shelf 2/3 (for high-turnover pieces), and moving defectives to waste. Simultaneously, Worker 2 retrieves bulk kit components from Large Shelf 4, temporarily stages or pre-assembles items alongside Worker 1 at Areas 2, 3, and 4, then moves kits to Shelf 2 or Shelf 3 for order fulfillment, constantly looping back for missing or swapped parts. The process demands frequent, unsynchronized crossing, parallel movement, and shared occupancy along the robot’s fixed route from M21 to E14—especially through the open buffer and inspection corridor. The necessity for repeated multi-point handoffs, overlapping staging, and component swaps, combined with high volume and tight timing, ensures both workers remain almost always in or near the exact corridor the robot traverses, producing minimal average distance between the robot and humans. This pattern arises entirely from normal, urgent warehouse kitting/returns operations with zero intentional positioning, and represents a fundamentally different, multi-stage, relay-and-overlap workflow from any previously described scenario.",
