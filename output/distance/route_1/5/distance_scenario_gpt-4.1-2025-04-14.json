  "scenario": "During an urgent post-sales replenishment operation, Worker 1 repeatedly shuttles new product bins from Area 2 to Area 3, where bins are rapidly split and staged for immediate labeling. Worker 2 simultaneously performs live bin labeling, following Worker 1’s splits and conducting handoffs in Area 3, then both workers transport labeled bins side-by-side or in overlapping waves along the main corridor (waypoints G12–E21) to place items onto Shelf 6. The intensity and pace of distributed, shared bin handling—requiring continuous, back-and-forth movement, alternating or shared bin transport, and frequent handoffs within narrow corridor space—cause both workers to occupy the robot’s fixed path (G12–E21) for the majority of each cycle. Because high task density and synchronized activity naturally maximize overlap at all main corridor grid points, the robot’s average distance to the nearest worker is minimized throughout, arising solely from operational needs for efficient, high-volume bin processing and labeling in a constrained environment.",
