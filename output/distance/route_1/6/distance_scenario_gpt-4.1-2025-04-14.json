  "scenario": "During a large-scale cross-docking and outbound order-building operation, two workers collaborate to assemble mixed-SKU pallet shipments using goods from bulk overflow storage (Large Shelf 4), recent inbound arrivals (Area 3), and fast-access stock (Shelf 6). Worker 1 shuttles items between Large Shelf 4, staging them at Area 3, and then moves assembled orders toward Shelf 6 for picking and dispatch. Worker 2 supports by rapidly receiving and checking inbound items at Area 3, retrieving additional SKUs from Shelf 6, and confirming quantities at Large Shelf 4, frequently alternating or working in tandem with Worker 1. Both workers perform batch staging, order reconciliation, and physical handoffs in or adjacent to Area 3 and along the main G12–E21 corridor—the robot's fixed route—resulting in persistent and dense overlap as each assembly cycle requires repeated proximity to the robot's path. Their legitimate, operationally driven movement and task requirements produce naturally minimized robot-to-worker distances, as both workers repeatedly transit, dwell, and interact within the core corridor, especially at high-overlap staging points, with all proximity arising organically from complex cross-dock assembly processes.",
