  "scenario": "During a synchronized quarterly audit and urgent stock transfer process, two workers operate side-by-side using a shared mobile workstation positioned near Area 3 and Shelf 6. Worker 1 audits segments of Shelf 6 and simultaneously stages transfer-requested stock from those sections at Area 3, while Worker 2 cross-verifies the audit, fetches replenishment items from Area 1/2, and restocks Shelf 6 immediately after each audited transfer. Both routinely converge at the shared workstation and Shelf 6, repeatedly traversing the main corridor (G12 to E21) alongside and sometimes together with the robot as it executes its fixed route. Frequent, collaborative use of the shared mobile workstation and space-constrained, segment-by-segment workflow ensure both workers remain in tightly overlapping proximity to the robot’s path throughout the process, minimizing the average distance between the robot and humans on the route due to real-world, audit-driven task demands and not intentional co-location.",
