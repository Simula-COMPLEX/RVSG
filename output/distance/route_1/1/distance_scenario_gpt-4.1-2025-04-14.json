  "scenario": "In a high-throughput outbound project, two warehouse workers simultaneously perform mobile quality control, sorting, and relabeling directly within the main corridor between Shelf 6 and Area 3, which completely overlaps the robot’s fixed transport route (G12 to E21). Worker 1 removes and inspects goods from Shelf 6, performs sorting and repacking side-by-side with Worker 2—who fetches supplies and alternates helping with labeling and staging—all within and along the corridor's primary waypoints. Both workers repeatedly traverse and occupy waypoints on and near the robot’s path as they shuttle items between Shelf 6, Area 3, and Area 5, alternating retrieval, inspection, and delivery tasks. The need for rapid, batch processing of urgent outbound goods creates dense, persistent human presence across the robot’s route, naturally minimizing the average distance between the robot and either worker by ensuring frequent, dynamic overlap and adjacency at multiple points during the robot’s operation.",
