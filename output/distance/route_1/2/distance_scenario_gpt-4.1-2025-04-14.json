  "scenario": "During a high-volume returns triage cycle, two workers operate in parallel: each starts at Area 5 to collect return parcels, transports them to Area 3 for shared inspection, then sorts each item for either restocking at Shelf 6 or disposal in the Waste Area. Both repeatedly move through the main corridors spanning G12–E21 (the robot's fixed route), either side-by-side or asynchronously, as they deliver restockables to Shelf 6 or waste to the Waste Area. Their independent but frequently overlapping workflows generate persistent and dense human presence along the robot’s path, minimizing the average distance between the robot and at least one worker at all times, as frequent staging, delivery, and return trips force them to share space with the robot across the central warehouse axes. All proximity arises naturally from high-traffic, task-driven returns management, with no direct human-robot communication or contrived movement.",
