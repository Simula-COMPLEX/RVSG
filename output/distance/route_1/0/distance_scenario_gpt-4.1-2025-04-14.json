  "scenario": "During a high-priority restocking and inspection cycle, two workers process newly received inventory for immediate storage. Worker 1 transports goods from the receiving point (Area 2) into the inspection area (Area 3), then, after staging and partial inspection, repeatedly moves items down the main corridor from Area 3 toward Shelf 6 for storage. Worker 2 works in parallel at the inspection area, rapidly checking items before also transporting them to Shelf 6 for replenishment, often alternating or collaborating with Worker 1 along the same corridor. Both workers’ primary workflow repeatedly and densely overlaps the robot’s fixed route (G12 to E21), leading to minimal average distance between robot and workers due to their shared transport, staging, and storage activities across the same zones and waypoints, all driven by the urgent need for efficient staging, inspection, and storage replenishment in the core central corridor.",
