  "scenario": "During an urgent inventory integrity check triggered by a suspected leak, Worker 1 (Inventory Auditor) and Worker 2 (Emergency Redistribution Specialist) conduct a rapid, overlapping triage and salvage operation. Worker 1 scans and inspects affected stock along Shelf 6, repeatedly transferring items to and from Area 3 for damage assessment, while Worker 2 cycles between Area 3, Shelf 6, Area 5, and the Waste Area to remove high-risk or contaminated items. Both workers persistently co-occupy the G12–E21 corridor, moving bins, staging recovered goods, and urgently shuttling between audits, removal, and prepping for redistribution. Their dense, emergency-driven collaboration and constant hands-on activity along the robot’s fixed route ensure the robot is nearly always in physical proximity to at least one worker. No actions are contrived for proximity; all overlap arises naturally from real, incident-driven warehouse salvage and assessment procedures.",
