  "scenario": "After a sudden bulk inventory surge, Workers 1 and 2 conduct simultaneous, multi-zone overflow redistribution and dynamic buffer management: Worker 1 rapidly transfers boxes from Region 1 (Boxes 1/2) through F12/G12 to buffer-drop at Areas 1 and 3, then cycles between Area 3 and Shelf 6 via the full G12–E21 corridor and occasionally Large Shelf 2. Meanwhile, Worker 2 collects overflow from Boxes 3 and Area 1, stages and sorts in Area 3, and repeatedly shuttles between Area 3, Area 5, and Shelf 6, moving shelfable boxes and retrieving buffer loads. Both frequently perform parallel or alternating staging at Area 3 and use the main corridor for nearly all zone transitions, resulting in repeated, organic co-occupation, handoffs, and near-collisions along the fixed robot path (G12–E21). This high-frequency, bidirectional, multi-zone redistribution—dictated by legitimate operational necessity and not contrived human-robot co-location—naturally minimizes the robot’s average distance to the nearest worker throughout its route.",
