Worker 2 works in parallel at the inspection area, rapidly checking items before also transporting them to Shelf 6 for replenishment, often alternating or collaborating with Worker 1 along the same corridor. Both workers’ primary workflow repeatedly and densely overlaps the robot’s fixed route (G12 to E21), leading to minimal average distance between robot and workers due to their shared transport, staging, and storage activities across the same zones and waypoints, all driven by the urgent need for efficient staging, inspection, and storage replenishment in the core central corridor.",

Both workers repeatedly traverse and occupy waypoints on and near the robot’s path as they shuttle items between Shelf 6, Area 3, and Area 5, alternating retrieval, inspection, and delivery tasks.

Worker 2, tasked with labeling, quality checking, and finalizing orders, alternates between Area 3 (receiving new bins), the E18–E21 corridor/border (preparing and staging ready orders at Shelf 6), and backtracking toward Area 3 for missing packing slips or urgent order confirmation. Both workers frequently occupy, cross paths on, or dwell along the robot’s G12–E21 path due to overlapping, urgency-driven handoffs and batch staging, especially at corridor bottlenecks or mutual retrievals, ensuring minimal physical distance to the robot throughout the process.

Worker 2 simultaneously performs live bin labeling, following Worker 1’s splits and conducting handoffs in Area 3, then both workers transport labeled bins side-by-side or in overlapping waves along the main corridor (waypoints G12–E21) to place items onto Shelf 6. The intensity and pace of distributed, shared bin handling—requiring continuous, back-and-forth movement, alternating or shared bin transport, and frequent handoffs within narrow corridor space—cause both workers to occupy the robot’s fixed path (G12–E21) for the majority of each cycle.

Both workers perform batch staging, order reconciliation, and physical handoffs in or adjacent to Area 3 and along the main G12–E21 corridor—the robot's fixed route—resulting in persistent and dense overlap as each assembly cycle requires repeated proximity to the robot's path. Their legitimate, operationally driven movement and task requirements produce naturally minimized robot-to-worker distances, as both workers repeatedly transit, dwell, and interact within the core corridor, especially at high-overlap staging points, with all proximity arising organically from complex cross-dock assembly processes.",
