  "scenario": "In response to an unplanned surge event and simultaneous stock imbalance notification, Worker 1 and Worker 2 engage in overlapping kit-building and dynamic stock-balancing operations centered on Area 3 and Shelf 6. Worker 1 shuttles kit components from Areas 1/2 to Area 3, assembles kits, and repeatedly moves to Shelf 6 for last-minute SKU retrievals and ad-hoc inventory tally transfers, returning to Area 3 via the main corridor. Worker 2 assists in kit assembly, stages finished kits from Area 3 to the end of Shelf 6 for dispatch, and performs urgent restocking by moving supplies from incoming bins (Area 2/5) to Shelf 6. Both workers frequently alternate, overlap, or coincide at Area 3, along corridors F12–F18, and E18–E21, naturally sharing and crossing the robot's fixed route (G12 to E21) with persistent, role-driven proximity as they repeatedly fetch, deliver, assemble, and balance stock in real time. All overlap and reduced average distance arise solely from the operational intensity and bidirectional demands of surge kit assembly and live inventory adjustment, not intentional co-location or communication with the robot.",
