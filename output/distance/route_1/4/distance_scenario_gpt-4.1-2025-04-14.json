  "scenario": "During a peak JIT dispatch operation triggered by a surge in outbound orders, Worker 1 continuously shuttles between Area 1 (collecting batch components), Area 3 (consolidating items), and Area 5 (picking up packing materials), then moves packed bins via the F-row and E-row corridors to the E18–E21 segment at Shelf 6. Worker 2, tasked with labeling, quality checking, and finalizing orders, alternates between Area 3 (receiving new bins), the E18–E21 corridor/border (preparing and staging ready orders at Shelf 6), and backtracking toward Area 3 for missing packing slips or urgent order confirmation. Both workers frequently occupy, cross paths on, or dwell along the robot’s G12–E21 path due to overlapping, urgency-driven handoffs and batch staging, especially at corridor bottlenecks or mutual retrievals, ensuring minimal physical distance to the robot throughout the process. All proximity arises organically from legitimate, high-intensity outbound order consolidation needs and dynamic environmental adaptation rather than engineered human-robot co-location.",
