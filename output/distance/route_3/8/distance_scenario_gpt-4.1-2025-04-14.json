  "scenario": "During an emergency high-speed cross-docking operation for a last-minute outbound shipment, Worker 1 (Multi-Zone Picker & Feeder) rapidly retrieves SKUs required for dispatch from Shelf 1 and Boxes 2–3, traveling repeatedly along the main corridor from Shelf 1 (A9) down to Area 1 (G4) for batch handoff, then immediately looping back to restart the pick. Concurrently, Worker 2 (Immediate Sorter, Packer & Floater) starts at Area 1 sorting incoming goods for dispatch, but is frequently compelled by urgent SKU checks or last-minute corrections to traverse the key warehouse path from Area 1 up to Shelf 1 and Boxes 2–3, often walking the same corridor, at times alongside or past Worker 1, and directly overlapping the robot's fixed route (A9 to G4). Their natural high-frequency crossings, frequent adjacency at both endpoints, and legitimate, task-driven double occupancy of the robot's navigation corridor ensure that the robot spends nearly all its operating time in close proximity to one or both workers. This dense, process-driven spatial overlap minimizes the robot’s average distance to the workers, solely as a result of real operational workflow and not by any intentional interference or direct interaction, with the robot autonomously adapting its movement only in response to physical obstructions presented by human presence or materials in the corridor.",
