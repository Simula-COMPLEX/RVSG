  "scenario": "During a morning receiving rush, two warehouse workers collaboratively handle inbound goods. Worker 1 (receiving specialist) opens and sorts boxes staged at Area 1 (G4) and Shelf 1 (A9), moving frequent loads along the main corridor (A9–G4). Worker 2 (quality inspector/replenisher) performs hands-on inspection at Area 1 and immediately restocks cleared items onto Shelf 1, using the same path. Their workflow results in constant, often side-by-side movement and occupation of the key corridor (A9 to G4), directly matching the fixed route of the robot, which autonomously shuttles items from Shelf 1 to Area 1. Both workers' legitimate operational activities—rapid alternating and collaborative movement between these points for sorting, inspection, and replenishment—keep them, through natural workflow, almost constantly within 1–2 meters of the robot as it completes its route, minimizing the average distance between workers and robot during task execution. At no time do the workers communicate or signal the robot; the robot reacts solely to changes in its environment.",
