  "scenario": "During an urgent bin-to-bin transfer and contamination recall screening, Worker 1 (Inventory Transfer Operator) repeatedly moves flagged inventory batches from Shelf 1 (A9) to Area 1 (G4) for temporary staging and rapid recall assessment, then returns cleared batches along the same route. Worker 2 (Contamination Sweeper) actively shadows Worker 1, staying in close proximity throughout the process to conduct on-the-spot contamination checks—sometimes stationed at Area 1 for batch arrival, sometimes meeting Worker 1 midway, and occasionally rushing alongside or past Worker 1 between A9 and G4 to fetch reference batches or assist with handoffs. Both workers' operationally required, highly synchronized movements result in persistent, dense congestion along the robot's fixed navigation route (A9 to G4), as their workflow compels them to remain almost continuously within arm’s reach of the robot or each other. This legitimate, high-intensity recall operation—anchored in a real world scenario—ensures that the robot’s average distance to the nearest human worker is minimized at nearly every stage of execution, driven entirely by critical workflow overlap and shared timing in the main aisle, without any direct human-robot interaction.",
