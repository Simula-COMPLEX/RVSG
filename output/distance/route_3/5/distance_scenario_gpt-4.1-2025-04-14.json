  "scenario": "A sudden express dispatch surge requires two warehouse workers to perform synchronized, high-frequency pick-pack tasks within the main robot navigation corridor. Worker 1 (Express Picker & Verifier) continuously retrieves urgent items from Shelf 1 (A9), verifies them, and hand-carries them down the main corridor to Area 1 (G4) for immediate packing, often looping back with empty containers. Worker 2 (Packager, Zone Floater & Dispatch Runner) operates from Area 1, prepping and packing incoming items, but also runs frequent cross-zone trips to Area 2 for specialty packing materials or outbound staging, and periodically meets Worker 1 mid-corridor for rapid handoffs or emergency restocks. Their operationally required, overlapping movement ensures that, at nearly every moment of the robot’s fixed route between Shelf 1 and Area 1, at least one worker is within arm's reach—sometimes both working side-by-side or passing each other adjacent to the robot's current waypoint. Dense, legitimate multitasking along the core corridor causes the smallest possible average distance between robot and workers, all emerging naturally from express order pressures, without any direct communication or intentional interaction.",
