  "scenario": "During an urgent pre-switchover serial compliance surge, Worker 1 (Serialization Validator & Transfer Cycler) continuously moves bulk serialized goods from Boxes 1–3 (Region 1) to Shelf 1 (A9), repeatedly traversing the main corridor (A2–A9), often adjacent to the robot's starting point. Worker 2 (Shelf-to-Area Serial Matcher & Sampler) works sequentially, retrieving checked goods from Shelf 1, then shuttling along the robot’s fixed path (A9→G4) to Area 1 (G4) for hands-on serial matching and sampling, occasionally returning items to Shelf 1 and repeating the loop. Their alternating, high-frequency cycles produce constant crossovers and shared presence at Shelf 1 and major robot waypoints, with natural workflow requiring both workers to repeatedly occupy nearly all points along the robot’s route. This generates maximum, persistent congestion for the robot and ensures the smallest possible average distance between the two workers and the robot—purely through legitimate and realistic operational overlap, never by intentional interference or direct interaction.",
