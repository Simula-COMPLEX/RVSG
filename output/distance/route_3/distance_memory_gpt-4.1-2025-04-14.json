    "summary": "During a morning receiving rush, two warehouse workers collaboratively handle inbound goods. Worker 1 (receiving specialist) opens and sorts boxes staged at Area 1 (G4) and Shelf 1 (A9), moving frequent loads along the main corridor (A9–G4). Worker 2 (quality inspector/replenisher) performs hands-on inspection at Area 1 and immediately restocks cleared items onto Shelf 1, using the same path. Their workflow results in constant, often side-by-side movement and occupation of the key corridor (A9 to G4), directly matching the fixed route of the robot, which autonomously shuttles items from Shelf 1 to Area 1. Both workers' legitimate operational activities—rapid alternating and collaborative movement between these points for sorting, inspection, and replenishment—keep them, through natural workflow, almost constantly within 1–2 meters of the robot as it completes its route, minimizing the average distance between workers and robot during task execution. At no time do the workers communicate or signal the robot; the robot reacts solely to changes in its environment.",

Meanwhile, Worker 2 (rapid restocker) urgently retrieves cleared items from Area 1 and restocks them onto Shelf 1, also frequently moving along the A9–G4 corridor. Both workers’ critical, overlapping tasks require constant back-and-forth movement between Shelf 1 and Area 1, independently and at high frequency. Their actions create natural congestion and near-constant adjacency to the robot, whose fixed route runs the same corridor. The result is that, through legitimate, high-urgency workflow requirements, one or both workers are almost always within close proximity to the robot throughout its operation, minimizing the average distance between the robot and the two workers during execution. The robot’s only response to the workers is to navigate around them or slow down as necessary, without any direct interaction.",

Worker 2 immediately collects relabeled items at Area 1 for further sorting, alternating between returning goods to Shelf 1 or rerouting them to Area 2 as needed, continuously traversing the same main corridor as the robot. Their bidirectional, overlapping movements create maximum congestion along the robot's fixed route, ensuring that one or both workers are nearly always in the direct vicinity of the robot throughout its entire operational loop.

Both workers' operationally required, highly synchronized movements result in persistent, dense congestion along the robot's fixed navigation route (A9 to G4), as their workflow compels them to remain almost continuously within arm’s reach of the robot or each other. This legitimate, high-intensity recall operation—anchored in a real world scenario—ensures that the robot’s average distance to the nearest human worker is minimized at nearly every stage of execution, driven entirely by critical workflow overlap and shared timing in the main aisle, without any direct human-robot interaction.",

Simultaneously, Worker 2 (Reclassification Specialist) begins at Boxes 1–2, consolidating inventory, then traverses the path from Region 1 to Area 1 (G4) to verify return classifications, immediately restocking certain items back on Shelf 1 (A9) before returning for further review or box transfer. Their legitimate workflows result in persistent, crisscrossing movement and shared occupation of the central robot route (A9–G4 and vicinity), with both workers frequently moving together or independently between all three major areas.

Their operationally required, overlapping movement ensures that, at nearly every moment of the robot’s fixed route between Shelf 1 and Area 1, at least one worker is within arm's reach—sometimes both working side-by-side or passing each other adjacent to the robot's current waypoint.

Meanwhile, Worker 2 (Order Preparer & Stock Reconciler) regularly shuttles between Shelf 1 and Area 1, conducting packing list cross-checks and assisting Worker 1 in merging or splitting order packs. Their work creates frequent, legitimate overlap as both move independently and collaboratively along the central corridor that matches the robot’s fixed path (A9→G4), with natural pausing, handoff, and verification causing continual close proximity between workers and the robot.

Their alternating, high-frequency cycles produce constant crossovers and shared presence at Shelf 1 and major robot waypoints, with natural workflow requiring both workers to repeatedly occupy nearly all points along the robot’s route.

Concurrently, Worker 2 (Immediate Sorter, Packer & Floater) starts at Area 1 sorting incoming goods for dispatch, but is frequently compelled by urgent SKU checks or last-minute corrections to traverse the key warehouse path from Area 1 up to Shelf 1 and Boxes 2–3, often walking the same corridor, at times alongside or past Worker 1, and directly overlapping the robot's fixed route (A9 to G4). Their natural high-frequency crossings, frequent adjacency at both endpoints, and legitimate, task-driven double occupancy of the robot's navigation corridor ensure that the robot spends nearly all its operating time in close proximity to one or both workers.
