  "scenario": "A rapid inventory relabeling and cross-zone sorting event requires two workers to repeatedly shuttle between Shelf 1 (A9) and Area 1 (G4) with a constant stream of products. Worker 1 retrieves goods from Shelf 1, moves to Area 1 for urgent relabeling, then hands off newly labeled items for sorting. Worker 2 immediately collects relabeled items at Area 1 for further sorting, alternating between returning goods to Shelf 1 or rerouting them to Area 2 as needed, continuously traversing the same main corridor as the robot. Their bidirectional, overlapping movements create maximum congestion along the robot's fixed route, ensuring that one or both workers are nearly always in the direct vicinity of the robot throughout its entire operational loop. The natural workflow demands frequent, high-throughput exchanges along the corridor, driving the smallest possible average distance between the robot and the two workers without direct interaction, solely through legitimate and urgent work processes.",
