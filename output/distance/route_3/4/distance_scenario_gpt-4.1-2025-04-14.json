  "scenario": "During a high-volume returns surge, Worker 1 (Returns Classifier) repeatedly collects incoming returns from Shelf 1 (A9), moves them to Area 1 (G4) for initial triage, then sorts and carries bulk restock items directly to Boxes 2–3 in Region 1, with frequent returns to Area 1 for new loads. Simultaneously, Worker 2 (Reclassification Specialist) begins at Boxes 1–2, consolidating inventory, then traverses the path from Region 1 to Area 1 (G4) to verify return classifications, immediately restocking certain items back on Shelf 1 (A9) before returning for further review or box transfer. Their legitimate workflows result in persistent, crisscrossing movement and shared occupation of the central robot route (A9–G4 and vicinity), with both workers frequently moving together or independently between all three major areas. This continuous, parallel cross-zone activity ensures the robot’s average distance to the workers along its fixed path is minimized, as its route is almost always populated by at least one nearby worker, without any direct human-robot interaction—driven solely by realistic operational overlap, item handling, and workflow congestion.",
