  "scenario": "During an urgent bulk-sorting and transit damage-control surge, two warehouse workers execute tightly overlapping, high-frequency cycles between Shelf 1 (A9) and Area 1 (G4) along the robot's main fixed path. Worker 1 (Bulk Extraction & Sorting Shuttle) continuously moves large loads from Shelf 1 to Area 1 for sorting, then rapidly loops back via the main corridor, frequently pausing at midpoints (e.g., D9, E8, F7) for load adjustment. Worker 2 (Dynamic Damage Inspector & Split-Lot Expediter) shadows Worker 1, inspecting offloaded goods at Area 1, then intermittently selects suspect lots and swiftly returns them to Shelf 1 for further scrutiny—sometimes pausing beside or leapfrogging Worker 1 at intermediate points for impromptu inspection or to deposit partially split loads. This unpredictable, high-throughput bidirectional occupancy of the main corridor—driven by legitimate, emergent process needs—means that the robot's entire fixed route is almost always shared by one or both workers, who are often in close parallel or reverse movement, naturally minimizing the average distance between the robot and the human workers for the duration of the task execution. All proximity is a consequence of genuine high-pressure sorting and quality control flow, never intentional congestion or direct interaction.",
