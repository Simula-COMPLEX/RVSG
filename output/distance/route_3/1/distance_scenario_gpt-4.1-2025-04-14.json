  "scenario": "During an unplanned cycle count audit coinciding with a high-priority restocking alert, Worker 1 (auditor/defective pull specialist) rigorously checks Area 1 and repeatedly travels to Shelf 1 to remove flagged defective stock, cycling defective items from Shelf 1 to Area 1 (and occasionally onward to the Waste Area). Meanwhile, Worker 2 (rapid restocker) urgently retrieves cleared items from Area 1 and restocks them onto Shelf 1, also frequently moving along the A9–G4 corridor. Both workers’ critical, overlapping tasks require constant back-and-forth movement between Shelf 1 and Area 1, independently and at high frequency. Their actions create natural congestion and near-constant adjacency to the robot, whose fixed route runs the same corridor. The result is that, through legitimate, high-urgency workflow requirements, one or both workers are almost always within close proximity to the robot throughout its operation, minimizing the average distance between the robot and the two workers during execution. The robot’s only response to the workers is to navigate around them or slow down as necessary, without any direct interaction.",
