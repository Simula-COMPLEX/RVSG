  "scenario": "During a high-pressure, pre-dispatch audit and overstock consolidation, Worker 1 (Audit & Overstock Picker) repeatedly travels from Area 1 (G4) to Boxes 3 (C7–C9) to collect extra inventory for urgent outbound orders, then returns via Shelf 1 (A9) to verify and cross-check contents before placing items in Area 1 for final packing. Meanwhile, Worker 2 (Order Preparer & Stock Reconciler) regularly shuttles between Shelf 1 and Area 1, conducting packing list cross-checks and assisting Worker 1 in merging or splitting order packs. Their work creates frequent, legitimate overlap as both move independently and collaboratively along the central corridor that matches the robot’s fixed path (A9→G4), with natural pausing, handoff, and verification causing continual close proximity between workers and the robot. At nearly all times, one or both workers are present along the robot's navigation route during active operation, driving the smallest possible average distance between them—entirely due to real workflow needs and shared resource access, not deliberate interaction.",
