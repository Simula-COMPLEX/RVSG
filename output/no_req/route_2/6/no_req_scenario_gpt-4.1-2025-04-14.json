  "scenario": "During a peak operational period, Worker 1 replenishes frequently accessed pick shelves (Shelf 2 and Shelf 3 in Region 2) with bulk stock from Large Shelf 4 (Region 4), transporting items along the central corridor using a pallet jack as needed. Simultaneously, Worker 2 picks outgoing order items from the same shelves for staging and inspection in Region 3 (Areas 1 and 2), then moves them to Area 5 for dispatch. The two workers' tasks regularly overlap at Shelf 2 and Shelf 3 and across central pathways, leading to shared resource and spatial congestion. An autonomous robot, tasked with transporting stock from Large Shelf 4 to the same shelves, navigates the same route and corridor. The robot responds autonomously to the presence of human workers and any temporary obstacles by pausing, rerouting, or waiting, based solely on physical workspace changes, without any direct communication or coordination with the workers. The scenario highlights realistic task and spatial crossover, indirect human–robot interference, and operational workflow congestion typical in mixed-activity warehouse environments.",
