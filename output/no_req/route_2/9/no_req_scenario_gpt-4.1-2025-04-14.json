  "scenario": "In a busy warehouse, a new inbound shipment is received. Worker 1 handles intake by moving goods from the staging area (Area 5) to operational Areas 1 and 2 for inspection and sorting, disposing of waste as needed. Worker 2 collects approved/sorted goods from Areas 1 or 2 and transports them to storage locations—mainly Shelf 2 or Shelf 3, but sometimes Large Shelf 4. Both workers repeatedly cross shared operational areas and aisleways, often working in proximity at Areas 1 and 2, and occasionally blocking key corridors or shelves during high activity. Meanwhile, an autonomous robot begins a task to move a load from Large Shelf 4 to Shelf 2 or 3, navigating via the main warehouse corridors and passing through central aisles where workers are active. The robot encounters variable delays and route adaptations as it detects and responds to temporary environmental obstructions created by the workers’ movements or by items/pallets the workers handle or stage in its path. No direct communication occurs, and all interactions are indirect and environmentally triggered, realistically replicating a contemporary warehouse with mixed autonomous and manual workflows.",
