  "scenario": "During a busy shift, two human workers and an autonomous robot operate simultaneously in the warehouse. Worker 1 manages incoming shipments by unloading, inspecting, and sorting goods in Area 5 and Area 2, disposing of waste as needed. Worker 2 retrieves inspected items from Area 2, transports them to Large Shelf 4, and transfers selected goods from Large Shelf 4 to replenish picking stock at Shelf 2 and Shelf 3. As the robot autonomously follows its route from Large Shelf 4 (M21) to Shelf 2 (E14), it navigates through central aisles and staging areas heavily trafficked by both workers. At times, shared pathways become temporarily blocked by pallets, carts, or ongoing sorting, causing the robot to pause or reroute based solely on environmental changes. Both workers' legitimate workflows and movements naturally introduce dynamic spatial congestion, with neither party directly interacting with the robot. The setting realistically depicts high-activity warehouse operations with constant indirect interplay between human and robotic tasks due to overlapping spatial needs and workflow stages.",
