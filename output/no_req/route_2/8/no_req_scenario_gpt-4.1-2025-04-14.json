  "scenario": "A replenishment specialist (Worker 1) repeatedly transfers and organizes bulk goods from Large Shelf 4 to Shelves 2 and 3 for restocking, using Area 2 for interim sorting. Simultaneously, an inspection and waste handler (Worker 2) receives goods in Area 2, conducts quality checks, and transports packaging waste to the Waste Area, traversing shared corridors and operational zones. Both frequently cross pathways and work side-by-side in Region 3 and near Shelf 2/3. A mobile robot autonomously transports a pallet from Large Shelf 4 to Shelf 2, navigating established waypoints and reacting in real time to changing obstacles—such as a worker, a cart, or waste bins—in its route as the two workers dynamically move throughout the warehouse, with no direct communication between humans and the robot.",
