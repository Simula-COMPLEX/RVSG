  "scenario": "During a busy restocking shift, Worker 1 sorts and inspects incoming deliveries at Area 1 and Area 2, then repeatedly transports approved goods to Shelf 2 and Shelf 3 for putaway, utilizing access aisles shared with the autonomous robot. Worker 2 collects inventory from Large Shelf 4, travels through central aisles using the same route as the robot, and delivers stock to Shelf 2 or 3 for replenishment. The robot autonomously travels from Large Shelf 4 to Shelf 2/3, carrying inventory along the same waypoint corridor. All three repeatedly converge in shared aisles and shelf zones due to independent, workflow-driven tasks; the robot reacts to dynamic environmental changes such as blocked aisles or shelf areas caused by human presence or temporarily placed items, pausing or rerouting as necessary with no direct communication. This operational scenario reflects a high-activity warehouse where both humans and robots perform overlapping storage and replenishment tasks in close proximity, resulting in frequent spatial and timing crossovers.",
