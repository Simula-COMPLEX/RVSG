You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point M21, close to Large Shelf 4, and travels leftward from row M to row E, moving from column 21 to column 14, and ends around E14 near Shelf 2 and Shelf 3. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: M21 → M20 → L20 → L19 → K18 → K17 → J17 → I17 → I16 → H16 → H15 → G15 → F15 → F14 → E14. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material transport task, picking up an item from Large Shelf 4 and delivering it to Shelf 2 or Shelf 3 for storage or replenishment.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**Detailed Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis**

### Operational Use Case: High-Throughput Replenishment with Overlapping Sorting & Storage

#### Scenario Overview
This scenario centers on a busy warehouse shift where incoming items from a recent delivery are being processed. The operation is focused on **replenishment and internal restocking**, involving both **sorting and putaway** actions. Two human workers and one autonomous robot must perform overlapping and, at times, spatially convergent tasks that are dictated by real demands for rapid restocking and order preparation.

---

#### Human Worker Roles and Assignments

**Worker 1: Sorting & Quality Inspection Specialist**  
- **Primary Activities**: Receives delivered goods, sorts them in operational zones, performs visual inspection for quality, and preps them for designated storage locations.
- **Zones Utilized**:  
  - Starts at **Area 1** (G–I, 5–8) in Region 3 for incoming goods sorting.
  - Moves to **Area 2** for overflow or secondary sorting.
  - Transports sorted and approved goods to relevant shelving zones, primarily **Shelf 2** and **Shelf 3** (Region 2, Columns 12–16).
  - Disposes of waste materials to the **Waste Area** after unboxing and sorting (F–J, 1–4).

**Worker 2: Putaway & Replenishment Operator**  
- **Primary Activities**: Picks bulk inventory or specific SKUs from **Large Shelf 4** (Region 4, L–M, 19–22), responds to replenishment requests by transporting stock towards **Shelf 2** and **Shelf 3**, and occasionally supports sorting if overflow occurs.
- **Zones Utilized**:  
  - Picks items from **Large Shelf 4** (L–M, 19–22).
  - Travels via main aisle (Row L/K, Columns 19–17) alongside or slightly after the robot’s route.
  - Delivers inventory to **Shelf 2/3** (Region 2) for restocking.
  - May utilize the **Pallet Jack** (G–H, 22) to move larger loads, integrating dispatch support.

---

#### Step-by-Step Scenario Sequence

1. **Morning Delivery**: New stock is unloaded near **Area 1** and **Area 2**. Worker 1 begins unboxing, sorting, and inspecting items at these zones. Rejected packaging is relocated by Worker 1 to the **Waste Area** (G–J, 1–4).

2. **Replenishment Triggered**: As high-demand SKUs are identified (typically stored at **Large Shelf 4**, M21–M19), Worker 2 proceeds to this shelf to retrieve stock for restocking.

3. **Initiation of Robot Task**:  
   - The robot, stationed near **M21** (close to Large Shelf 4), detects inventory to be restocked on **Shelf 2** or **Shelf 3**.
   - The robot initiates its programmed path: **M21 → ... → E14**, following waypoints alongside Worker 2 in the main aisle.

4. **Operational Concurrency**:
   - **Worker 2** physically retrieves goods from **Large Shelf 4** and moves, usually by foot, but may use the **Pallet Jack** if moving bulk loads, traveling along the robot’s planned route.  
   - Both Worker 2 and the robot repeatedly converge at high-traffic passageways (Rows K–F, Columns 20–14).

5. **Sorting & Overflow**:
   - **Worker 1** brings items deemed ready for storage from **Area 1/2** to central shelves (**Shelf 2/3**), frequently approaching from the south and west, using aisles occupied by both the robot and Worker 2.
   - If Area 1 becomes full, Worker 1 temporarily relocates overflow to **Area 3/4**, adding further cross-traffic near Shelf 2/3.

6. **Putaway & Stocking**:
   - **Worker 2**, carrying items from Large Shelf 4, and the robot may approach Shelf 2 or Shelf 3 nearly simultaneously or in quick succession, interfering with each other spatially.
   - Both the robot and human can encounter impromptu obstructions, such as temporarily placed pallets, carts, or even each other pausing to restock shelves, causing transient blockages at choke points (e.g., E14, E16, F14–F16).

7. **Robot Environmental Response**:
   - The robot’s sensors detect obstacles (e.g., Worker 2 stopped to place goods at Shelf 2, or temporary pallet near E14).
   - The robot autonomously reroutes, pauses, or temporarily halts until the path is clear, strictly guided by the physical realities (not by commands or signals from workers).
   - Once space reopens, the robot resumes and completes delivery to Shelf 2/3.

8. **Cycle Repeats**:
   - As restocking and sorting cycle continues, both human workers and the robot repeatedly encounter shared zones at varying times, with workflow-driven overlap causing frequent, environmentally-driven interruptions and reroutes by the robot.

---

### Operational Realism Justification

- **Workflow Alignment**: The scenario accurately reflects high-throughput, demand-driven warehouse restocking where sorting, inspection, and putaway cannot occur in isolated silos—especially with limited aisle space and overlapping operational needs.
- **Role Rationale**: Worker 1 mirrors a receiving/QA/putaway hybrid often needed when delivery and storage timing are tight. Worker 2 aligns with replenishment/stock movement roles prevalent in shared environments where robots also operate.
- **Zone Utilization**: Movement across multiple regions, as dictated by layout and access pathways, enforces natural spatial crossovers and shared aisle occupancy.
- **No Direct Human-Robot Interaction**: All robot actions are the result of tangible, real-world environmental changes, i.e., navigation obstacles—fully consistent with autonomous operations.
- **Congestion & Interference**: Realistic choke points (main aisle, shared shelf fronts) make mutual interference operationally probable, not contrived.

---

### **JSON Scenario Summary**
```json
{
  "scenario": "During a busy restocking shift, Worker 1 sorts and inspects incoming deliveries at Area 1 and Area 2, then repeatedly transports approved goods to Shelf 2 and Shelf 3 for putaway, utilizing access aisles shared with the autonomous robot. Worker 2 collects inventory from Large Shelf 4, travels through central aisles using the same route as the robot, and delivers stock to Shelf 2 or 3 for replenishment. The robot autonomously travels from Large Shelf 4 to Shelf 2/3, carrying inventory along the same waypoint corridor. All three repeatedly converge in shared aisles and shelf zones due to independent, workflow-driven tasks; the robot reacts to dynamic environmental changes such as blocked aisles or shelf areas caused by human presence or temporarily placed items, pausing or rerouting as necessary with no direct communication. This operational scenario reflects a high-activity warehouse where both humans and robots perform overlapping storage and replenishment tasks in close proximity, resulting in frequent spatial and timing crossovers."

========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**Worker 1: Sorting & Quality Inspection Specialist**

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**
1. **Area 1 → Waste Area**: Begin at Area 1 to inspect and unbox incoming goods, separating packaging waste.
2. **Waste Area → Area 2**: Dispose of waste in the Waste Area, then proceed to Area 2 to continue sorting or handle overflow items.
3. **Area 2 → Shelf 2**: Move inspected, approved goods from Area 2 to Shelf 2 for putaway, supporting replenishment.
4. **Shelf 2 → Shelf 3**: If further inventory needs distribution or overflow exists, place items on Shelf 3.
5. **Shelf 3 → Area 1**: Return to Area 1 to repeat the sorting/inspection cycle.

**Reasoning:**
- **Start at Area 1**, as this is the primary incoming goods and sorting zone.
- **Waste removal** (Area 1 → Waste Area) is essential for keeping the workspace clear and aligns with the operational need for efficient unboxing/inspection cycles.
- **Transitioning to Area 2** reflects the real overflow and parallel sorting that naturally occurs under high throughput—keeping Worker 1 in the two most relevant operational areas.
- **Putaway to Shelf 2 (and optionally Shelf 3)** ensures immediate replenishment of high-demand items, supporting the process flow where new stock is urgently needed on those shelves.
- **Returning to Area 1** closes the loop and positions Worker 1 to repeat this high-throughput, QA-driven workflow, always starting their next cycle where new goods enter the process.


**Worker 2: Putaway & Replenishment Operator**

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**
1. **Large Shelf 4 → Shelf 2**: Start at Large Shelf 4, pick required inventory/SKUs, and transport them to Shelf 2 for restocking.
2. **Shelf 2 → Shelf 3**: Move to Shelf 3 to further replenish or deliver specific items, reflecting the shared demand for these shelves.
3. **Shelf 3 → Pallet Jack**: Use the Pallet Jack (if needed) stationed near Area 5 to collect additional bulk loads or prepare to move dispatched goods.
4. **Pallet Jack → Large Shelf 4**: Return the Pallet Jack (drop-off or park) and resume at Large Shelf 4 to initiate the next replenishment cycle.

**Reasoning:**
- **Start at Large Shelf 4**, as Worker 2 is responsible for retrieving bulk or overflow inventory stored here.
- **Delivering to Shelf 2 and then Shelf 3** mirrors real operational practice: restocking both shelves based on immediate replenishment needs, and maximizing efficiency along the main aisle shared with the robot.
- **Proceeding to the Pallet Jack** integrates occasional use of mechanical aid for heavy or bulk movements, often directly following putaway to prepare for the next trip or support dispatch.
- **Looping back to Large Shelf 4** maintains a continuous replenishment cycle and ensures Worker 2 is always positioned at the bulk stock origin for the next round.

---

**Summary Explanation:**

Each sequence maintains logical, workflow-driven movement through the warehouse, maximizing operational efficiency, minimizing redundant travel, and ensuring all replenishment and inspection tasks proceed smoothly in alignment with the real demands of the high-activity scenario. Both cyclic paths support the collaborative, high-throughput restocking and putaway process without direct interdependence, fulfilling the overall operational goal of rapid inventory flow and shelf availability.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


**Worker 1: Sorting & Quality Inspection Specialist**

---
**Step 1: Area 1 → Waste Area**  
- **Start:** G5 (Area 1)  
- **End:** F3 (Waste Area)  
- **Waypoint Path:** [G5, F5, F4, F3]  
- **Explanation:**  
G5 is a valid Area 1 point closest to the Waste Area to the left. The path moves horizontally to F5, then F4, finally to F3 (Waste Area). This is the most direct, obstruction-free path using only valid waypoints and avoids any invalid entries in the vicinity. Edge waypoint F3 is chosen for efficient direct transfer of waste.

---

**Step 2: Waste Area → Area 2**  
- **Start:** F3 (Waste Area)  
- **End:** G8 (Area 2)  
- **Waypoint Path:** [F3, F4, F5, G5, G6, G7, G8]  
- **Explanation:**  
From F3, move right along Row F (the warehouse’s main horizontal corridor), then upwards to G5 (Area 1, also a valid transfer zone), and straight through G6, G7, to G8 (Area 2's edge). This route avoids obstacles, makes use of the southern part of the warehouse, and demonstrates how functional transitions between separated areas are managed.

---

**Step 3: Area 2 → Shelf 2**  
- **Start:** G8 (Area 2)  
- **End:** B12 (Shelf 2)  
- **Waypoint Path:** [G8, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12]  
- **Explanation:**  
From G8, move upward to the main Row F corridor, then right to the Row F/C/D/B column (12), rising up through the shelf zone’s front access points. B12 is selected as it’s a shelf edge point (per area valid waypoints), and the route leverages both horizontal corridor efficiency and valid edge accessibility.

---

**Step 4: Shelf 2 → Shelf 3**  
- **Start:** B12 (Shelf 2)  
- **End:** B14 (Shelf 3)  
- **Waypoint Path:** [B12, B13 (blocked),* B14]  
- **Note:** B13 is explicitly listed as an invalid waypoint. Thus, **must use an alternative path.**  
- **Alternative Path:**  
  [B12, C12, C13, C14, B14]  
- **Explanation:**  
B12 exits up to C12 (a shared valid shelf waypoint), then sideways through C13 (valid for Area 3), C14 (valid for Shelf 3), and finally down to B14. This detour avoids the invalid B13 yet is only minimally longer and keeps the route efficient.

---

**Step 5: Shelf 3 → Area 1**  
- **Start:** B14 (Shelf 3)  
- **End:** G5 (Area 1)  
- **Waypoint Path:** [B14, C14, D14, E14, F14, G5]  
- **Explanation:**  
From B14, drop to the next valid shelf waypoints (C14, D14), continue down through the open main passage (E14, F14), and finish east by reaching G5 at the edge of Area 1, thus bringing the worker full-circle. This path uses only valid shelf and corridor points.

---

**Worker 2: Putaway & Replenishment Operator**

---
**Step 1: Large Shelf 4 → Shelf 2**  
- **Start:** M21 (Large Shelf 4)  
- **End:** B12 (Shelf 2)  
- **Waypoint Path:** [M21, L21, K21, J21 (blocked),* J20, I20, H20, G20, F20, F19, F18, F17, F16, F15, F14, F13, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12]  
- **Note:** J21 is explicitly listed as invalid, so must avoid.  
- **Alternative Route:**  
  [M21, L21, K21, K20, J20, I20, H20, G20, F20, F19, F18, F17, F16, F15, F14, F13, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12]  
- **Explanation:**  
From M21, proceed up the right-most edge (columns 21–20). As J21 is blocked, reroute to K20 and J20, then continue upward through the valid vertical aisle (column 20), shifting left as necessary to align with the Shelf 2 waypoints. This route demonstrates efficient long transit from the warehouse's southern edge to a central shelf, making explicit use of edge points (M21, L21, K21) and avoiding invalid waypoints.

---

**Step 2: Shelf 2 → Shelf 3**  
- **Start:** B12 (Shelf 2)  
- **End:** B14 (Shelf 3)  
- **Waypoint Path:** [B12, C12, C13, C14, B14]  
- **Explanation:**  
As in Worker 1 Step 4, B13 is invalid, so the route goes up to C12, sideways to C13 (valid), over to C14, then down to B14. This is the shortest detour possible.

---

**Step 3: Shelf 3 → Pallet Jack**  
- **Start:** B14 (Shelf 3)  
- **End:** G21 (Pallet Jack)  
- **Waypoint Path:** [B14, C14, D14, E14, F14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21]  
- **Explanation:**  
From B14, move south through valid vertical shelf waypoints and Row E corridor to F14, then right along Row G through valid Area 4 waypoints, reaching edge waypoint G21 (Pallet Jack). Route stays in open aisles before threading through Area 4, maximizing wayfinding efficiency using area-appropriate waypoints.

---

**Step 4: Pallet Jack → Large Shelf 4**  
- **Start:** G21 (Pallet Jack)  
- **End:** M21 (Large Shelf 4)  
- **Waypoint Path:** [G21, H21, I22, J22, K22, L22, M22, M21]  
- **Explanation:**  
From the Pallet Jack, head up to H21, then right to I22 (Pallet Jack valid), and proceed down the right-most corridor toward the southern edge using valid edge points J22, K22, L22, M22, and then left to M21. This path brings Worker 2 directly to Large Shelf 4’s right edge, closing the operational loop. The use of column 22's edge waypoints enables fast travel along otherwise restricted back-of-warehouse pathways, fully leveraging the instruction to use edge points where available.

---

**Summary:**  
Each path strictly adheres to valid, area-specific waypoints, carefully avoids all listed invalid points, and maximizes spatial efficiency while leveraging corridors and edge-access as per the warehouse layout and operational requirements. Paths are direct, realistic, and intentionally use edge waypoints (e.g., M21, M22, I22, A12, F3) when it improves efficiency or is functionally appropriate for transitions at the warehouse boundaries.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.


==================================================


Below, I review each worker’s full loop step by step, according to all specified requirements.  
For each step:  
- I first check the start, end, and every intermediate waypoint.  
- I specifically check that waypoints within each functional area are drawn only from that area’s allowed list, and that no "invalid" waypoint is used at any point.  
- For each error, I explain the issue and propose a corrected path, ensuring area entry/exit is performed at valid points.  
- I confirm continuity, and after all steps, check for a closed loop.

# WORKER 1

### Step 1: Area 1 → Waste Area
**Path:** [G5, F5, F4, F3]  
**Check:**
- **Start:** G5 (Area 1 valid)
- **End:** F3 (Waste Area valid)
- **Waypoints**:
  - G5: valid, in Area 1 list
  - F5: F row, not listed as invalid
  - F4: F row, not listed as invalid
  - F3: Waste Area, valid
  
**Issue:**  
- No invalid waypoints.  
- G5 is valid for Area 1, F3 is valid for Waste Area.  
- All transitions are continuous.

**Correction:**  
- **No correction needed.**

---

### Step 2: Waste Area → Area 2  
**Path:** [F3, F4, F5, G5, G6, G7, G8]  
**Check:**
- **Start:** F3 (Waste Area valid)
- **End:** G8 (Area 2 valid)
- **Waypoints**:
  - F3: Waste Area (valid)
  - F4: valid
  - F5: valid
  - G5: Area 1 (valid for Area 1, but not Area 2)
  - G6: Area 1 (valid for Area 1, not Area 2)
  - G7: Area 1/Area 2; **G7 is valid for both.**
  - G8: valid for Area 2

**Errors:**
- If intending Area 2, worker should enter Area 2 exclusively via [G7, G8, G9, G10].
- **G5** and **G6** are only valid as Area 1 entry/exit, not for Area 2 task.  
- The route passes through Area 1’s exclusive waypoints (G5, G6) while going to Area 2, violating area-specific entry/exits.

**Correction:**  
- Waste Area (F3) is closest to Area 2 entry at G7 or G8.
- Valid verticals: F3 → F4 → F5 → F6 → F7 → G7.
- **Recommended Corrected Path:** [F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, G7, G8]

  - F3 (Waste, valid)
  - F4 (valid)
  - F5 (valid)
  - F6 (valid)
  - F7 (valid)
  - G7 (Area 2, valid)
  - G8 (Area 2, valid - destination)
  
**Summary of correction:**  
Worker leaves Waste Area via safest corridor/access point (F3-F4-F5-F6-F7), then enters Area 2 directly by its valid G7 access. This uses only valid in-area entry/exit points.

---

### Step 3: Area 2 → Shelf 2  
**Path:** [G8, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12]  
**Check:**
- **Start:** G8 (Area 2 valid)
- **End:** B12 (Shelf 2 valid)
- **Waypoints in Area 2:** G8 (Area 2), F8 (not in Area 2's allowed list)
- **Leaving Area 2 at G8, should transfer out directly to route corridor.**
- Are any waypoints "invalid" on this path?
  - F8, F9, F10, F11, F12 are not listed as invalid on Row F.
  - E12, D12, C12, B12 are valid for Shelf 2.
- All transitions are legal with respect to pathway continuity.

**Error:**  
- **No invalid waypoints.**
- **Area transition okay:** G8 is a valid exit for Area 2 to general warehouse.
- Path uses only valid waypoints. No waypoints in Area 2 after G8.

**Correction:**  
- **No correction needed.**

---

### Step 4: Shelf 2 → Shelf 3  
**Path:** [B12, C12, C13, C14, B14]  
**Check:**
- **Start:** B12 (Shelf 2, valid)
- **End:** B14 (Shelf 3, valid)
- **Waypoints:**
  - B12: valid (Shelf 2)
  - C12: valid (Shelf 2)
  - C13: **Invalid** (Row C, C13 is explicitly blocked!)
  - C14: valid (Shelf 3)
  - B14: valid (Shelf 3)
- **Intended move is B12 → C12 → C14 → B14 without passing C13, which is invalid.**

**Error:**  
- **C13** is a blocked/invalid waypoint.

**Correction:**  
Find legal route avoiding C13:
- B12 → C12 (valid)
- D12 (valid, Shelf 2)
- D14 (valid, Shelf 3)
- C14 (valid, Shelf 3)
- B14 (valid, Shelf 3)

**Direct path:**  
- B12 → C12 → D12 → D14 → C14 → B14

But D13 is also invalid!  
- Let's check Shelf 2's valid waypoints: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14.
- From B12, go up to C12 → D12. Then from D12 to D14: D13 is invalid.
- So, can't go from D12 (12) to D14 (14) directly (would need to pass D13).
- Similarly, C12 to C14 via C13: C13 is invalid.

So, perhaps need to step down from shelf to Row E or move laterally before moving up:

Try:  
B12 → C12 → D12 → E12 (not on shelf, but open) → E14 → D14 → C14 → B14
But D13 and C13, again, are both invalid. Similarly, E13 (Row E, 13) is not on invalids list.

So:  
B12 → C12 → D12 → E12 → E13 → E14 → D14 → C14 → B14

But E13 is valid (not on the blocked list)! Now, check transitions:

- B12 (valid, Shelf 2)
- C12 (valid, Shelf 2)
- D12 (valid, Shelf 2)
- E12 (Row E, valid)
- E13 (Row E, valid)
- E14 (Row E, valid)
- D14 (valid, Shelf 3)
- C14 (valid, Shelf 3)
- B14 (valid, Shelf 3)

**Proposed Corrected Path:**  
[B12, C12, D12, E12, E13, E14, D14, C14, B14]

**All transitions are legal and avoid invalid waypoints.**

---

### Step 5: Shelf 3 → Area 1  
**Path:** [B14, C14, D14, E14, F14, G5]  
**Check:**
- **Start:** B14 (Shelf 3, valid)
- **End:** G5 (Area 1, valid)
- Waypoints: All in free space or their respective areas, not listed as invalid.
- G5 is a valid entry for Area 1.

**Error:**  
- **No invalid waypoints.**  
- The path enters Area 1 only at G5 (allowed).

**Correction:**  
- **No correction needed.**

---

#### Full loop for Worker 1  
End of Step 5 (G5) matches starting point in Step 1, confirming a closed, continuous loop.

# WORKER 2

### Step 1: Large Shelf 4 → Shelf 2  
**Path:** [M21, L21, K21, K20, J20, I20, H20, G20, F20, F19, F18, F17, F16, F15, F14, F13, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12]  
**Check:**
- **Start:** M21 (Large Shelf 4, valid)
- **End:** B12 (Shelf 2, valid)
- **Waypoints on Large Shelf 4:** M21 (valid for Large Shelf 4)
- **Waypoints on Shelf 2:** B12 (valid for Shelf 2)
- All other waypoints: Check if any are on the invalids list:
  - L21: valid (not on "invalid" for row L)
  - K21: valid (not on "invalid" for row K)
  - K20: valid
  - J20: valid (**J20 is NOT on the invalid list; J21 is invalid**)
  - I20: **Invalid!** (row I, I20)
- I20 is on the invalid list. So path is invalid at I20.
- Also, check H20 (valid), G20 (Area 5 valid), F20, F19, F18, F17, F16, F15, F14, F13, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12 (all valid except as otherwise noted).

**Error:**  
**I20 is invalid.**

**Correction:**  
Must route around I20.  
Try avoiding both I20 and J21 (invalid).  
Let's attempt a lateral move at J20.

From K20 → J20, can't go up to I20 (blocked), so try K20 → J20, then J19 (invalid), so can't go left. Try K19. K19 is not invalid, continue upward: K19 → J19 (invalid); upward to I19 (invalid). Can't do lateral shifts to left.

Consider alternate column: go from K21 up to G21, which is on the Area Valid Waypoint (Pallet Jack) and is NOT invalid, then traverse horizontally. Let's reconstruct:

- M21 (Large Shelf 4)
- L21 (valid)
- K21 (valid)
- J22 (valid)
- I22 (valid)
- H21 (valid)
- G21 (Pallet Jack valid point)
- G20 (Area 5 valid)
- F20
- F19
- F18
- F17
- F16
- F15
- F14
- F13
- F12
- E12
- D12
- C12
- B12

But after K21, is J22 a valid waypoint? Yes, for Row J, J22 is not among listed invalids.

**Proposed corrected path:**  
[M21, L21, K21, J22, I22, H21, G21, G20, F20, F19, F18, F17, F16, F15, F14, F13, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12]

- J22 (valid), I22 (Pallet Jack valid), H21 (Pallet Jack valid), G21 (Pallet Jack valid/Area 5 valid).
- Continue through Area 5 and main horizontal corridors to Shelf 2.

**All waypoints checked for absence from invalid list and correct for transition.**

---

### Step 2: Shelf 2 → Shelf 3  
**Path:** [B12, C12, C13, C14, B14]  
**Check:**
- As in Worker 1, Step 4: C13 is invalid.

**Correction:**  
Use the Worker 1-corrected path:  
[B12, C12, D12, E12, E13, E14, D14, C14, B14]

---

### Step 3: Shelf 3 → Pallet Jack  
**Path:** [B14, C14, D14, E14, F14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21]  
**Check:**  
- **Start:** B14 (Shelf 3, valid)
- **End:** G21 (Pallet Jack valid)
- **Waypoints:**
  - B14 (valid, Shelf 3)
  - C14, D14, E14, F14 (all valid, general warehouse or shelf area)
  - G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20 (all valid for Area 4 or Area 5, as per lists)
  - G21 (valid, Pallet Jack)
- No invalids in this segment.

**Correction:**  
- **No correction needed.**

---

### Step 4: Pallet Jack → Large Shelf 4  
**Path:** [G21, H21, I22, J22, K22, L22, M22, M21]  
**Check:**  
- G21: Pallet Jack valid
- H21: Pallet Jack valid
- I22: Pallet Jack valid
- J22, K22, L22, M22: all valid (none listed as invalid)
- M21: Large Shelf 4 valid (ending)

**Correction:**  
- **No correction needed.**

---

#### Full loop for Worker 2  
- Final step ends at M21, which is Worker 2’s starting point, forming a closed, continuous loop.

---

# SUMMARY OF VALIDATION AND CORRECTED ROUTES

**Errors found and corrections proposed:**
- **Worker 1, Step 2:** G5 and G6 (Area 1 waypoints) were used on route to Area 2. Correct route is: [F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, G7, G8].
- **Worker 1, Step 4 & Worker 2, Step 2:** C13 (invalid), corrected with lateral move through Row E and legal shelf waypoints: [B12, C12, D12, E12, E13, E14, D14, C14, B14].
- **Worker 2, Step 1:** I20 (invalid); route now avoids I20 and J21, rerouted via [M21, L21, K21, J22, I22, H21, G21, G20, F20, F19, F18, F17, F16, F15, F14, F13, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12].

**All routes are now valid, continuous, area-compliant, and closed-loop.**

========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
