========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point M21, close to Large Shelf 4, and travels leftward from row M to row E, moving from column 21 to column 14, and ends around E14 near Shelf 2 and Shelf 3. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: M21 → M20 → L20 → L19 → K18 → K17 → J17 → I17 → I16 → H16 → H15 → G15 → F15 → F14 → E14. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material transport task, picking up an item from Large Shelf 4 and delivering it to Shelf 2 or Shelf 3 for storage or replenishment.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**STEP-BY-STEP SCENARIO ANALYSIS**

### Overview
This scenario simulates a high-activity period in a mid-sized warehouse where both routine stock replenishment (storage) and outbound order processing (dispatch) occur simultaneously. The scenario leverages the defined regions, the robust navigation grid, and realistic constraints stemming from the physical environment, spatial layout, and natural workflow overlap. Both workers and an autonomous robot operate in time-constrained and spatially intersecting workflows, occasionally crossing paths or using shared staging/sorting areas.

---
#### Worker and Robot Role Assignment

**Worker 1: Replenishment Operator**
- Primary Role: Responsible for transferring bulk inventory from Large Shelf 4 (Region 4) to replenish fast-moving SKUs on Shelf 2 (Region 2).
- Tasks:
  - Moves empty bins from Shelf 2 (Region 2) to Area 1 or 2 (Region 3) for temporary staging.
  - Retrieves appropriate cases/boxes from Large Shelf 4 (Region 4).
  - Transports replenishment stock along the main corridors and places them onto Shelf 2, taking the shortest, most direct path.
  - Occasionally sorts or inspects damaged goods, moving unsalvageable items to the Waste Area (Region 3).

**Worker 2: Order Picker/Packer**
- Primary Role: Prepares customer orders for outbound dispatch, requiring frequent access to the same shelf locations and operational zones.
- Tasks:
  - Picks ordered items from Shelf 2 or Shelf 3 (Region 2).
  - Brings picked items to Area 3 for inspection and packaging.
  - Occasionally retrieves auxiliary packaging material from Large Shelf 4, sharing access with Worker 1.
  - After packaging, transports finished parcels to Area 5 (dispatch staging) in Region 3 and, when required, deposits non-sellable waste into the Waste Area.

**Robot: Autonomous Transporter**
- Primary Role: Facilitates material movement between storage and shelving, following the route M21 → E14. The robot autonomously identifies and avoids obstacles (e.g., occupied waypoints or blocked pathways) created by the human workers or moved stock, but never interacts or communicates with the humans directly.
- Tasks:
  - At scenario start, waits at L/M 20/21 until the loading zone (Large Shelf 4) is clear.
  - Navigates through shared corridors (e.g., K18, J17, H16) which may be occupied by either or both workers.
  - If a worker temporarily blocks a waypoint (e.g., when accessing Shelf 2 or handling stock in Areas 1–3), the robot delays, reroutes, or pauses until the path clears.
  - Upon reaching E14, deposits or collects material from Shelf 2 or 3 as needed.

---
#### Scenario Flow with Overlap, Congestion, and Environmental Reactivity

1. **Receiving and Replenishment Start**  
   - Worker 1 begins at Area 3, returns empty bins to Shelf 2 (navigating G15, F15, E14).
   - Simultaneously, the robot is staged at M21, ready to pick up material from Large Shelf 4 (L–M, 20–22) but waits if Worker 1 is blocking access.

2. **Concurrent Material Transport**  
   - Worker 1 carries cases along L/M21→K18→J17; overlaps occur at main corridor junctions.
   - Worker 2, starting at Area 5, heads to Shelf 2 via F15→E14 to pick order items, sometimes sharing the aisle with Worker 1 or having to wait briefly if a path is congested.

3. **Shared Access and Mutual Congestion**  
   - Both workers may reach for boxes at Shelf 2, leading one to wait (not due to negotiation, but because only one can access the bin at a time due to space).
   - Worker 2 may detour via K17/H16 to access Large Shelf 4 for packaging supplies, passing through or near the robot’s navigation route.
   - The robot, detecting Worker 2 physically present at E14 or in the adjacent aisle, waits until the space is clear before completing its storage task.

4. **Dynamic Path Adjustments**  
   - If Worker 2 is packaging at Area 3 (H/I, 15–18) and blocks waypoints H16/H15, the robot reroutes or pauses at F15 or G15, resuming once the area is clear.
   - Worker 1, after replenishing Shelf 2, moves waste items to the Waste Area by traversing back through heavily trafficked corridors, possibly meeting the robot or Worker 2 in the main aisles.

5. **Scenario Resolution**  
   - Both workers, working independently within their functional roles but with high overlap in shared walkways and picking areas, generate sporadic congestion, with the robot dynamically adapting its behavior to their presence in real-time.
   - All tasks (stock put-away, order picking, packaging, waste removal, and robot-assisted material movement) follow logical workflow imperatives and practical warehouse layouts, with no direct coordination or communication between any party.

---
#### Realism and Operational Fit

This scenario is operationally realistic because:
- Inventory replenishment and order processing commonly occur simultaneously in real-world warehouses, and physically overlap in central, high-access shelving areas.
- Human workers frequently encounter each other in shared corridors, operational areas, and picking zones without intentionally interfering but must navigate temporary bottlenecks.
- Robots in modern warehouses function autonomously and rely on environmental awareness, adjusting paths based solely on dynamic physical changes (e.g., obstacles, blocked aisles).
- All worker movements and zone transitions are driven by actual process requirements, supporting a practical flow of goods and task alternation.
- The grid-based layout and explicit waypoint system mirror industry standards for AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot) navigation, lending additional credibility.

**SCENARIO SUMMARY (JSON FORMAT)**

```json
{
  "scenario": "During a busy warehouse shift, Worker 1 replenishes fast-moving products from Large Shelf 4 to Shelf 2, periodically returning empty bins and disposing of damaged stock in the Waste Area. Simultaneously, Worker 2 picks customer orders from Shelf 2 and Shelf 3, transfers them to Area 3 for packing, and then brings completed orders to the dispatch staging in Area 5, occasionally retrieving packaging supplies from Large Shelf 4. An autonomous robot collects boxes from Large Shelf 4 and delivers them to Shelf 2 following a fixed navigation route, adapting in real time to environmental changes caused by both workers who frequently occupy or traverse shared corridors, picking zones, and operational areas, leading to variable congestion and requiring the robot to pause, reroute, or delay until paths are clear. All human-robot influence arises solely from physical workspace overlap, with no direct interaction or communication."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**Worker 1: Replenishment Operator**

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**
1. **Area 1 → Large Shelf 4**: Start in Area 1 (staging/temporary holding), move to Large Shelf 4 to retrieve replenishment stock.  
   *Reasoning*: Worker 1 begins at a staging area to simulate gathering empty bins or preparing for restocking. Large Shelf 4 is the source of bulk replenishment stock, aligning with the worker's role.

2. **Large Shelf 4 → Shelf 2**: Transport the replenishment stock from Large Shelf 4 to Shelf 2 (Region 2) for restocking.  
   *Reasoning*: This movement is the core replenishment action—moving inventory to fast-moving storage (Shelf 2), fulfilling the primary operational goal.

3. **Shelf 2 → Area 2**: Return empty bins or any removed packaging to Area 2 (another staging/sorting zone).  
   *Reasoning*: After restocking, removing empty containers to a staging area supports operational tidiness and prepares for waste segregation or reuse.

4. **Area 2 → Waste Area**: Bring any unsalvageable or damaged items from the staging area to the Waste Area for proper disposal.  
   *Reasoning*: Waste handling must follow immediately after staging to prevent accumulation and maintain workflow cleanliness.

5. **Waste Area → Area 1**: Return to Area 1 to begin the cycle again.  
   *Reasoning*: Closing the loop ensures the worker is back at the starting location, ready to recommence the replenishment cycle.

---

**Worker 2: Order Picker/Packer**

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**
1. **Area 3 → Shelf 2**: Start in Area 3 (packing/inspection zone), move to Shelf 2 to pick ordered items.  
   *Reasoning*: Worker 2 begins from the packing/inspection station, simulating readiness to fulfill orders, and proceeds to a frequently accessed SKU location.

2. **Shelf 2 → Shelf 3**: After picking from Shelf 2, pick any remaining items required for the order from Shelf 3.  
   *Reasoning*: Many orders require multiple SKUs; moving from Shelf 2 to Shelf 3 efficiently utilizes the adjacent picking areas.

3. **Shelf 3 → Large Shelf 4**: Go to Large Shelf 4 to collect packaging materials (boxes, filler, etc.) as needed for the order.  
   *Reasoning*: Sourcing packaging materials is often integrated into the pick/pack workflow and Large Shelf 4 is the logical storage for bulk supplies.

4. **Large Shelf 4 → Area 3**: Return with items and packaging to Area 3 for inspection and packing.  
   *Reasoning*: All picked items and materials converge at the inspection/packing workspace, maintaining the workflow cycle.

5. **Area 3 → Area 5**: Carry packed orders to Area 5 (dispatch staging area).  
   *Reasoning*: Orders ready for shipment must be moved to dispatch staging, a key step towards completing outbound fulfillment.

6. **Area 5 → Area 3**: Return to Area 3 to begin the next cycle.  
   *Reasoning*: Ensures the worker is always ready in the packing/inspection zone, maintaining task continuity and operational flow.

---

**Reasoning Summary:**

- **Worker 1’s sequence** connects staging, bulk storage, replenishment, and waste handling in a logical loop, reflecting standard replenishment and housekeeping roles in a real warehouse.
- **Worker 2’s sequence** efficiently links picking, packing, material staging, and dispatch in a single, repetitive loop, reflecting typical outbound order preparation tasks.
- Both task sequences ensure efficient use of space, logical flow of materials, and frequent traversal of shared functional areas, maintaining high operational realism within the constraints of the warehouse layout and previously described scenario. Each end point feeds directly into the starting point, sustaining process continuity.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


**WORKER 1: REPLENISHMENT OPERATOR**

---

**Step 1: Area 1 → Large Shelf 4**

- **Start:** G4 (Area 1)
- **End:** M21 (Large Shelf 4, near warehouse edge)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G4, H4, I4, J4, K4, L4, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, M10, M11, M12, M13, M14, M15, M16, M17, M18, M19, M20, M21]

- **Explanation:**  
  Starting from G4 (Area 1), which is located towards the left edge of the warehouse, the route progresses downward along the G row’s valid waypoints, shifting horizontally at each row break. It utilizes M21 (an edge and valid Large Shelf 4 location) to access the far-right end of the shelf zone. The route avoids passing through any invalid waypoints and leverages edge access to reach storage at the layout’s perimeter.

---

**Step 2: Large Shelf 4 → Shelf 2**

- **Start:** M21 (Large Shelf 4)
- **End:** A14 (Shelf 2, warehouse top/edge)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [M21, L21, K21, J21, I21, H21, G21, F21, E21, D21, C21, B21, A21, A20, A19, A18, A17, A16, A15, A14]

- **Explanation:**  
  Departing from M21, the worker travels vertically upward using the edge column (21), then progressively shifts left on row A, stopping at the edge waypoint A14 (valid for Shelf 2). The path takes advantage of the entire right edge of the warehouse, steering clear of all central invalid points and using A14 as a legitimate shelf access, demonstrating optimal use of edge navigation for efficient restocking.

---

**Step 3: Shelf 2 → Area 2**

- **Start:** A14 (Shelf 2)
- **End:** G8 (Area 2)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [A14, B14, C14, D14, E14, F14, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8]

- **Explanation:**  
  This path starts at an upper-edge shelf and moves downward, following only valid blue waypoints and cutting horizontally and then vertically towards Area 2’s valid points. G8 is chosen as the closest entry to Area 2 from this direction. No invalid waypoints are traversed, and the path remains efficient along functional junctions.

---

**Step 4: Area 2 → Waste Area**

- **Start:** G8 (Area 2)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]

- **Explanation:**  
  The route keeps to the G row along valid points, moving left across Area 2 into the Waste Area, directly connecting two adjacent operational areas for optimal waste transfer.

---

**Step 5: Waste Area → Area 1**

- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **End:** G4 (Area 1)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G3, G4]

- **Explanation:**  
  This is a single-step lateral move between side-by-side areas on the G row, taking a direct and only valid path. Both waypoints are valid for their respective areas, and the edge is naturally used in Waste Area access, forming a complete loop for Worker 1.

---

**WORKER 2: ORDER PICKER/PACKER**

---

**Step 1: Area 3 → Shelf 2**

- **Start:** G11 (Area 3)
- **End:** A14 (Shelf 2)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G11, F11, E11, D11, C11, B11, A11, A12, A13, A14]

- **Explanation:**  
  From G11 (Area 3), the route moves upward in the warehouse, using only valid waypoints vertically and then shifting right along the edge row (A) to approach Shelf 2 at A14. This efficiently exploits the open corridor and upper edge to minimize detours and avoid any invalid central grid points.

---

**Step 2: Shelf 2 → Shelf 3**

- **Start:** A14 (Shelf 2)
- **End:** A16 (Shelf 3)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [A14, A15, A16]

- **Explanation:**  
  Worker 2 transitions directly along the A row between two adjacent shelves, leveraging valid edge waypoints for very fast movement. No obstacles or invalid points are along this short path, maximizing efficiency for sequential picking.

---

**Step 3: Shelf 3 → Large Shelf 4**

- **Start:** A16 (Shelf 3)
- **End:** M22 (Large Shelf 4)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [A16, B16, C16, D16, E16, F16, G16, H16, I16, J16, K16, L16, M16, M17, M18, M19, M20, M21, M22]

- **Explanation:**  
  From upper-edge A16, the worker descends through valid points in a single column (16) all the way to the bottom, using valid points in each row to shift onto M16, then moves right along the bottom row to the far edge (M22) of Large Shelf 4, thus maximizing edge access and avoiding central invalids.

---

**Step 4: Large Shelf 4 → Area 3**

- **Start:** M22 (Large Shelf 4)
- **End:** G14 (Area 3)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [M22, L22, K22, J22, I22, H22, G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14]

- **Explanation:**  
  Worker 2 reverses the bottom edge, heading left from the far-right Large Shelf 4 position and then up to re-enter the Area 3 cluster at G14. The leftward travel and then upward movement uses only valid points and leverages G row area entries, maximizing the bottom and side edge corridors.

---

**Step 5: Area 3 → Area 5**

- **Start:** G14 (Area 3)
- **End:** G20 (Area 5)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20]

- **Explanation:**  
  A straightforward, rightward movement along the G row with all waypoints valid for Areas 3 and 5. The direct route supports efficient transfer of completed orders to dispatch staging.

---

**Step 6: Area 5 → Area 3**

- **Start:** G20 (Area 5)
- **End:** G11 (Area 3)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11]

- **Explanation:**  
  The return path follows the G row in the opposite direction, traversing only valid area waypoints and looping the worker back to the starting point at Area 3 to restart the picking/packing cycle.

---

**GENERAL NOTES ON EDGE WAYPOINT USAGE AND EFFICIENCY:**
- All edge waypoints (rows A, M, columns 1, 22) are leveraged wherever assigned as valid for area access or optimal for bypassing central congestion.
- Obstacle avoidance is inherently respected by never plotting through forbidden waypoints.
- Route selection maximizes straight, non-zigzagging corridors for both vertical and lateral tasks, reducing time and conflict in high-activity zones, matching the logic and operational reality of the original scenario.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.


==================================================


Certainly! Below is a comprehensive validation review and correction process for each worker’s waypoint path segments.

---

## **WORKER 1: REPLENISHMENT OPERATOR**

---

### **Step 1: Area 1 → Large Shelf 4**
- **Start:** G4 (Area 1 Valid)
- **End:** M21 (Large Shelf 4 Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [G4, H4, I4, J4, K4, L4, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, M10, M11, M12, M13, M14, M15, M16, M17, M18, M19, M20, M21]

**Validation**:
- **G4, H4, I4, J4**: All are valid and within Area 1.
- **K4, L4**: Not listed as invalid waypoints, but also not included in any Area Valid Waypoints list for task access to Large Shelf 4. However, they are necessary hallway points (per general warehouse navigation) and thus usable as connectors.
- **M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, ... M21**: Only M18–M22 are valid access points for Large Shelf 4, per area requirements. M4–M17 are not valid for Large Shelf 4, nor for any corridor function (since M row is only valid at Large Shelf 1–4 points).

**Error(s):**
- The path uses M4–M17, which are not listed as valid for either corridor navigation or as listed points for Large Shelf 4.

**Correction**:
- Navigate from Area 1 down to K4, then use central corridors (E/F/K row) to right edge, then approach Large Shelf 4 via valid points only.
- Valid path could be:  
  [G4, H4, I4, J4, K4, K9, K13, K17, K18, L18, M18, M19, M20, M21]
  - Enter M18–M21 from K18/L18, only using valid "Large Shelf 4" access points (M18-M22).  
  - (Intermediate points K4 → K9 → K13 → K17 → K18 are standard for central aisle navigation.)

---

### **Step 2: Large Shelf 4 → Shelf 2**
- **Start:** M21 (Large Shelf 4 Valid)
- **End:** A14 (Shelf 2 Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [M21, L21, K21, J21, I21, H21, G21, F21, E21, D21, C21, B21, A21, A20, A19, A18, A17, A16, A15, A14]

**Validation**:
- **M21**: Valid (Large Shelf 4).
- **L21 → K21 → ... → A21**: L21, K21, etc. – NOT valid waypoints: Row L/K/J/I/H/G/F/E/D/C/B/A, Col 21 are not valid access points (they are not listed as central corridor points and, in fact, A21 is explicitly INVALID).
- **A21**: Explicitly INVALID (Row A).
- **A20, etc.**: Among A20-A14, only A14 is valid for Shelf 2; the rest are not valid access points for aisle navigation.

**Error(s):**
- Illegal use of A21 (invalid), other 21-column waypoints, and non-area-valid waypoints for shelf access.

**Correction**:
- Best routing (using valid access points and transferring between main corridor and edge access as allowed):
  - From M21 (Large Shelf 4), move up using valid Large Shelf 4 waypoints to M18, then up via edge columns to a main corridor, then transition through valid points to Shelf 2's valid access point.
  - Example revised path:  
    [M21, M20, M19, M18, L18, K18, J18, I18, H18, G18, F18, E18, D14, C14, B14, A14]  
    - Uses valid access points in Large Shelf 4 (M18–M21) and navigates to valid access point A14 for Shelf 2 (valid).

---

### **Step 3: Shelf 2 → Area 2**
- **Start:** A14 (Shelf 2 Valid)
- **End:** G8 (Area 2 Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [A14, B14, C14, D14, E14, F14, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8]

**Validation**:
- **A14–G14**: All are valid as vertical transitions.
- **G14–G8**: Only G10, G9, and G8 are valid for Area 2.
- **G14–G13–G12–G11**: These are Area 3 valid points, not Area 2 points.

**Error(s):**
- G14–G13–G12–G11 are not valid points for Area 2 and do not preserve direct transition.

**Correction**:
- Route must enter from a valid access to G10 (Area 2's highest-numbered access), without entering Area 3's points.
- Possible correct path:  
  [A14, B14, C14, D14, E14, F14, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8]  
  However, best direct entry is from G14 → G13 → G10 (but G13 is not Area 2).
- So, instead:
  - [A14, B14, C14, D14, E14, F14, G14, F10, G10, G9, G8]  
  But F10 is not valid.
  - Therefore, best is:  
    [A14, B14, C14, D14, E14, F14, G10, G9, G8]  
    *Transition from F14 to G10 is vertical and permitted by navigation grid.*
    - **Note:** Only use G10, G9, G8 (all valid for Area 2).

---

### **Step 4: Area 2 → Waste Area**
- **Start:** G8 (Area 2 Valid)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]

**Validation**:
- All waypoints are valid.
- G3 is legitimate for the Waste Area.

**No errors found.**

---

### **Step 5: Waste Area → Area 1**
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area Valid)
- **End:** G4 (Area 1 Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [G3, G4]

**Validation**:
- G3 (Waste Area), G4 (Area 1): both valid, adjacent row points.
- Path is valid.

---

---

## **WORKER 2: ORDER PICKER/PACKER**

---

### **Step 1: Area 3 → Shelf 2**
- **Start:** G11 (Area 3 Valid)
- **End:** A14 (Shelf 2 Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [G11, F11, E11, D11, C11, B11, A11, A12, A13, A14]

**Validation**:
- **G11:** Area 3 valid.
- **F11, E11, D11, C11, B11, A11:** None of these are valid area points for transit; A11 is explicitly INVALID.
- A12, A13: also invalid.
- Only A14 is valid for Shelf 2.

**Error(s):**
- Broken by invalid use of A11, etc., and invalid for A13.

**Correction**:
- Use main corridors, staying on valid transitions. Best route:
  - From G11 (Area 3 valid), move up via vertical grid to F14, then up through columns 14 via valid points:
    [G11, F14, E14, D14, C14, B14, A14]
    - All are valid.

---

### **Step 2: Shelf 2 → Shelf 3**
- **Start:** A14 (Shelf 2 Valid)
- **End:** A16 (Shelf 3 Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [A14, A15, A16]

**Validation**:
- **A15**: Explicitly INVALID on Row A.

**Error(s):**
- Route passes through A15, which is listed as invalid.

**Correction**:
- Must route via valid points on A or minimal lateral movement using alternative row.
- Use B14 → B16 (both valid: B14 is valid for Shelf 2; B16 for Shelf 3).  
  Example:  
  [A14, B14, B16, A16]  
  *(transition down to B14, lateral move to B16, up to A16)*

---

### **Step 3: Shelf 3 → Large Shelf 4**
- **Start:** A16 (Shelf 3 Valid)
- **End:** M22 (Large Shelf 4 Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [A16, B16, C16, D16, E16, F16, G16, H16, I16, J16, K16, L16, M16, M17, M18, M19, M20, M21, M22]

**Validation**:
- Each row/col must be checked for validity:
  - B16, C16, D16, E16, F16, G16, H16, I16, J16, K16, L16, M16 (only M16–M22 are valid for Large Shelf 4).
- H16: Not explicitly invalid (valid).
- I16: Not invalid (valid).
- J16: Valid.
- M16: Only M18–M22 are valid for Large Shelf 4, M16/M17 are only for Large Shelf 3.
- Therefore, M16/M17 are invalid for Large Shelf 4 transition.

**Error(s):**
- Includes M16/M17 (not valid Large Shelf 4 points).

**Correction**:
- Route to bottom corridor near M18, then proceed only via valid Large Shelf 4 access points (M18–M22).
- Use K18, L18 for corridor, accessing M18 directly:
  - [A16, B16, C16, D16, E18, F18, G18, H18, I18, J18, K18, L18, M18, M19, M20, M21, M22]
  - E18-F18-G18-H18-I18-J18 are all valid navigation and “corridor” points.  
  - M18–M22: All valid for Large Shelf 4.

---

### **Step 4: Large Shelf 4 → Area 3**
- **Start:** M22 (Large Shelf 4 Valid)
- **End:** G14 (Area 3 Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [M22, L22, K22, J22, I22, H22, G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14]

**Validation**:
- L22, K22, J22, I22, H22, G21:  
  - H22, G22: Explicitly INVALID.
  - L22, K22, J22, I22 are valid for navigation, but not as area endpoints.
- Route uses G22 (invalid at row G).
- G21: valid for Area 5, not Area 3.

**Error(s):**
- Includes H22, G22 (both explicitly invalid).

**Correction**:
- Route from M22 up via main allowed columns (corridor), move horizontally through valid waypoints:
  - [M22, M21, M20, M19, M18, L18, K18, J18, I18, H18, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14]
    - All points are legitimate for the walk back toward Area 3, ending at G14 (Area 3 valid).

---

### **Step 5: Area 3 → Area 5**
- **Start:** G14 (Area 3 Valid)
- **End:** G20 (Area 5 Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20]

**Validation**:
- All are valid waypoints for Areas 3, 4, 5.

**No errors found.**

---

### **Step 6: Area 5 → Area 3**
- **Start:** G20 (Area 5 Valid)
- **End:** G11 (Area 3 Valid)
- **Path:**  
  [G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11]

**Validation**:
- All are valid waypoints for Areas 5, 4, 3.

**No errors found.**

========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
