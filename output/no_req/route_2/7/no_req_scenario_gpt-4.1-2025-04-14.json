  "scenario": "During a busy warehouse shift, Worker 1 replenishes fast-moving products from Large Shelf 4 to Shelf 2, periodically returning empty bins and disposing of damaged stock in the Waste Area. Simultaneously, Worker 2 picks customer orders from Shelf 2 and Shelf 3, transfers them to Area 3 for packing, and then brings completed orders to the dispatch staging in Area 5, occasionally retrieving packaging supplies from Large Shelf 4. An autonomous robot collects boxes from Large Shelf 4 and delivers them to Shelf 2 following a fixed navigation route, adapting in real time to environmental changes caused by both workers who frequently occupy or traverse shared corridors, picking zones, and operational areas, leading to variable congestion and requiring the robot to pause, reroute, or delay until paths are clear. All human-robot influence arises solely from physical workspace overlap, with no direct interaction or communication.",
