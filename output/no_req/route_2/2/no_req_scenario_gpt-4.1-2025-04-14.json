  "scenario": "During a peak internal restocking and sortation cycle, Worker A frequently transfers bulk stock from Region 1 (Boxes 1–3) through Area 1 for sorting and delivers items to Shelf 2 and Shelf 3, often pausing to stage or correct inventory in Area 2. Worker B simultaneously stages new arrivals at Area 5, inspects or repackages items in Area 3 and Area 4, returns compliant stock to Shelf 2 or Large Shelf 4, and regularly removes waste to the Waste Area. Both workers frequently occupy or cross main corridors at E/F14–18 and share access to Shelf 2 and Shelf 3, causing dynamic congestion and intermittent blockage of grid waypoints. An autonomous robot collects inventory from Large Shelf 4 (M21) and transports it via the main corridors to Shelf 2/Shelf 3 (E14), pausing or rerouting only in response to physical obstacles created by the workflow activities of the workers, such as their presence or the temporary placement of materials.",
