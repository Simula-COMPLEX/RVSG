  "scenario": "A shipment of goods is received at Area 1 and Area 2 by Worker A, who unpacks, inspects, and sorts items, occasionally disposing of waste in the Waste Area. Worker B collects inspected goods from Area 2 and replenishes Shelf 2 and Shelf 3 or relocates overflow to Large Shelf 4, frequently traversing shared aisles and occasionally using the pallet jack. Both workers alternately and repeatedly access the same staging and storage zones, causing intermittent congestion in main corridors and at shelf entrances. An autonomous robot, starting at Large Shelf 4 (M21), transports stock for replenishment to Shelf 2 or Shelf 3 (E14), using the central corridors and valid waypoints. The robot autonomously halts or reroutes when workers or their equipment temporarily block its navigation path, resuming or adjusting its route only when these environmental obstacles clear, never directly interacting or communicating with the workers.",
