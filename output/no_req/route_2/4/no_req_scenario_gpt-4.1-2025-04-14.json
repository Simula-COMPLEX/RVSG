  "scenario": "Two warehouse workers and an autonomous robot operate concurrently during a high-activity restocking shift. Worker 1 manages receiving and inspection at Area 5, sorts goods for shelving or bulk storage, moves inspected stock to Boxes 1–3 or pre-stages it in Area 2. Worker 2 handles shelf replenishment, collects items from Area 2 and Large Shelf 4, and restocks Shelf 2 and Shelf 3, frequently traversing central corridors. The robot autonomously transports items from Large Shelf 4 to Shelf 2, following a set waypoint path. As both workers and the robot traverse overlapping pathways and perform similar tasks in shared zones, the robot’s movement is occasionally delayed or altered solely by indirect physical obstructions—workers, carts, or staged goods positioned along its route—mirroring natural congestion and unplanned workflow intersections. No direct communication occurs; all interaction arises from shared environment dynamics typical of real warehouses.",
