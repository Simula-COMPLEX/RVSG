  "scenario": "During a high-activity inbound and replenishment shift, Worker 1 unloads and sorts mixed goods in Area 5, stages items at Area 2 and Large Shelf 4, and disposes of irreparable items in the Waste Area. Worker 2 inspects goods at Area 2, clears staged stock from Large Shelf 4, and regularly replenishes Shelf 2 and 3, traversing the main central corridor. Both workers frequently operate in overlapping zones, especially at Area 2, Large Shelf 4, and along the primary navigation route. Meanwhile, the autonomous robot collects an item from Large Shelf 4 and follows a preset route to deliver it to Shelf 2 or 3. The robot dynamically responds to environmental changes such as worker presence or staged items, pausing or rerouting if its path is blocked, but has no direct interaction with the humans. This creates ongoing, realistic workflow interference, congestion, and collaborative zone use crucial for efficient warehouse operation.",
