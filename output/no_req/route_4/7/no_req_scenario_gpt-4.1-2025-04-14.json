  "scenario": "Two human workers operate in a busy warehouse where Worker 1 receives and sorts bulk goods from Boxes 1–3 to operational Areas 1 and 2 for sorting and inspection, also moving waste to the Waste Area. Worker 2 inspects and transfers sorted goods from Area 2 to staging (Area 4) and pre-dispatch (Area 5) zones, occasionally using the pallet jack for heavy items while organizing these spaces and removing discovered waste. Simultaneously, an autonomous robot collects an item from Large Shelf 1 and transports it via designated grid corridors to Area 4 for staging, using valid waypoints and dynamically reacting to worker-induced obstructions such as occupied corridors, moved boxes, or pallet jack activity that temporarily block its route. All agent interactions are indirect, emerging from shared workspace activity, and the scenario features frequent overlaps and mutual influence but no direct communication or task exchange between workers and the robot.",
