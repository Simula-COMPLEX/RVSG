  "scenario": "Two human workers and an autonomous robot jointly support a restocking and inspection cycle in the warehouse. Human Worker 1 receives incoming goods near Large Shelf 1 in Region 4, moves items through the main corridor, and stages or sorts them in operational Areas 1 and 2, sometimes removing waste material to the Waste Area. Human Worker 2 inspects, sorts, and either moves approved items into storage (Region 2 shelves, Region 1 boxes, or Large Shelf 3/4) or defective materials to waste, circulating between operational zones and storage areas—repeatedly crossing Worker 1’s routes and working in the same sorting/staging zones. The robot autonomously picks up items from Large Shelf 1, navigates through high-traffic pathways, and delivers them to Area 4 for further inspection or processing, adjusting its route or waiting if worker activity blocks its way. No direct communication occurs, but frequent environmental overlaps and indirect interference create a dynamic, realistic multitasking workflow, mirroring real warehouse operational challenges.",
