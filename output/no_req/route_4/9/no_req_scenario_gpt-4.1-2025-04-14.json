  "scenario": "During a high-volume inbound period, Worker 1 continuously unloads and shelves bulk items at Large Shelf 1 (Region 4), frequently moving items onto the shelf and staging batches near the main corridor. Simultaneously, Worker 2 collects these staged items, transports them to Area 4 (Region 3) for rapid sorting and inspection, and cycles back for additional loads. The autonomous robot detects a newly placed item at Large Shelf 1, initiates a transport route toward Area 4, and must frequently pause or reroute along shared pathways and at the drop-off zone due to both workers’ movements and temporary obstructions like carts and boxes. All interactions arise from overlapping operational workflows, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion rather than any direct human-robot communication. The robot proceeds or adjusts solely based on the evolving physical environment shaped by the workers’ independent, task-driven activities.",
