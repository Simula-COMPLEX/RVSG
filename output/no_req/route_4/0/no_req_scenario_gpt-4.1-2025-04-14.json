  "scenario": "During a peak inbound window, Worker 1 receives and sorts new stock in Region 3 (Areas 1–2 and Waste Area), cycling boxes from the pallet jack at G22/H22 into holding and discarding zones. Concurrently, Worker 2 picks replenishment stock from Large Shelves 1–2 (Region 4) and transports items along the L/K corridors to Area 4 (H17) for staging, often encountering Worker 1's overflow or temporary deposits. An autonomous robot independently follows a predefined navigation route starting near Large Shelf 1 (M5), carrying a load to Area 4, relying solely on obstacle detection to avoid humans. Both Worker 2 and the robot must access Area 4, frequently arriving at the same time, creating intermittent spatial congestion. The robot pauses or reroutes as needed in response to human presence or item placement, without any direct exchange, exemplifying real-world shared-space operations with overlapping picking and material staging by human and robotic actors.",
