  "scenario": "During a high-throughput afternoon shift, two human workers operate in a warehouse handling incoming inventory and internal stock rotation. Worker 1 is responsible for unloading and initially sorting received boxes in Areas 1 and 2, frequently moving items and waste between operational zones and the Waste Area. Worker 2 collects sorted boxes from Area 2, placing them onto assigned storage shelves or returning them for re-inspection or dispatch via Area 4, regularly accessing both high-traffic storage regions and operational areas. Simultaneously, an autonomous robot retrieves an item from Large Shelf 1 and moves it along a pathway crossing major corridors to Area 4. Both workers often occupy or pass through the robot’s route and shared pathways, resulting in frequent, dynamic congestion. The robot, operating entirely autonomously and without any direct human interaction, pauses or reroutes as needed in response to physical obstructions created by the workers' activities or objects temporarily blocking its waypoints. This scenario replicates real-world warehouse pressure where human and robotic workflows overlap and influence each other solely through environmental presence and activity.",
