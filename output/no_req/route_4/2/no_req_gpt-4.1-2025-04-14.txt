========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point M5, close to Large Shelf 1, and travels rightward from row M to row H, moving from column 5 to column 17, and ends around H17 in Area 4. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: M5 → M6 → L6 → L7 → L8 → L9 → K9 → K10 → K11 → K12 → J13 → J14 → I14 → I15 → I16 → H16 → H17. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material relocation task, picking up an item from Large Shelf 1 and delivering it to Area 4 for sorting, inspection, or further processing.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**Detailed Scenario Analysis**

**Operational Use Case:**  
**High-Throughput Afternoon Shift: Receiving, Sorting, and Internal Relocation of Incoming Inventory with Concurrent Human-Robot Activity**

**Context:**  
It is early afternoon during a busy shift in a general merchandise warehouse. A shipment has just arrived, containing mixed stock destined both for immediate replenishment of storage zones and for rapid dispatch after inspection. Space is limited in the operational zones, requiring frequent clearing and rapid throughput. The workflow involves receiving, visual inspection, sorting, internal relocation to storage shelves, and preparation for dispatch. Two workers and an autonomous robot are simultaneously active.

---

**Human Worker Roles:**

**Worker 1 – Receiving & Initial Sorting Specialist**  
*Primary Tasks:*
- Unload incoming boxes delivered to the staging area near Area 1 (Region 3; G8–I9).  
- Perform initial sorting: quickly group the boxes by type and urgency for dispatch or storage, using Area 1 and Area 2 (G8–I12).
- Place immediately dispatchable or high-priority items into Area 2 (H10–I12) and direct others toward storage or further inspection.
- Move packaging waste to the Waste Area (F2–H4).
*Movement Zones:*
- Works primarily across Areas 1 and 2, but frequently travels via grid points along K9/K12 and G8–I12. Sometimes crosses the main horizontal pathway (E–L) to dispose of waste or clear congested areas.
- Occasionally steps into main pathway to fetch sorting aids or relocate carts.

**Worker 2 – Storage & Relocation Specialist**  
*Primary Tasks:*
- Retrieves boxes designated for storage from Area 2 (I11–I12).
- Transports and places items into assigned storage zones:
    - Fast-moving goods onto Region 2 Shelves 3 or 4 (A–E, 14–17).
    - Bulkier or long-term stock onto Region 4 Large Shelves (L–M, 6–9 or 11–14).
- Occasionally collects items from storage for inspection in Area 4 or combined dispatch, using the shortest paths through pathways such as K9–K12 and via main vertical corridors.
- Brings damaged or unneeded goods to Waste Area, sharing access with Worker 1.
*Movement Zones:*
- Moves between operational zones (Area 2, Area 4, Waste Area) and storage areas (shelves, large shelves), often using the main corridor grid points (especially K9–K13, E10–E17, L6–L14).

---

**Robot Autonomous Task:**  
- Programmed to relocate a specific box from Region 4 Large Shelf 1 (L6–M6, lower left) to Area 4 (H16–H17) for inspection or pre-dispatch sorting.
- Travels along the specified waypoint path: M5 → M6 → L6 → ... → H16 → H17.
- The robot only reacts to physical obstructions or moved inventory—if a path is blocked by a worker, box, or cart, it pauses or reroutes as needed.

---

**High-Activity, Overlap, and Environmental Dynamics:**

- Both workers legally and operationally use Areas 1, 2, and 4, with overlapping interest in the main corridors (K9–K12, L6–L9, I14–H17), especially during periods of high traffic or when multiple items arrive for rapid staging and storage.
- Workers frequently cross or temporarily occupy the robot’s route while sorting or carrying boxes, sometimes blocking a waypoint (e.g., K9, I14, or H16–H17) to access a shelf or operational zone.
- Waste transit and sorting congestion around Area 2 occasionally cause both workers to pause temporarily in main corridors, further increasing robot path blockages.
- At several steps, the robot must wait for the pathway near K9, I14, or H17 to clear before continuing, dynamically responding to worker presence or misplaced inventory left in narrow corridors—never due to an explicit instruction.
- Both workers use the shared pathways for similar or alternating tasks, intensifying congestion: Worker 1 finishing initial sort while Worker 2 queues to move items for storage, both converging at central or edge waypoints (e.g., intersections around I14/K13).
- During high throughput, both human workers might traverse identical functional areas simultaneously or in rapid succession, sometimes briefly obstructing each other or the robot, inadvertently influencing the robot's progress.

---

**Operational Realism Justification:**  
This scenario reflects intense, realistic warehouse throughput typical of busy shifts, especially during inventory receipt or just-in-time restocking cycles. The shared use of pathways and functional areas is operationally necessary to maintain flow despite spatial constraints. Both workers’ roles—receiving/sorting and storage/relocation—are standard, and division of labor with overlapping access to staging and storage zones is common for efficiency. The robot's material movement simulates integrating autonomous systems into existing workflows where automation supports, but does not dominate, throughput. No direct human-robot communication occurs, with all robot responsiveness arising only from environmental context changes (blockages, object movement), meeting modern warehouse process automation and safety requirements.

---

**Scenario Summary (JSON):**
```json
{
  "scenario": "During a high-throughput afternoon shift, two human workers operate in a warehouse handling incoming inventory and internal stock rotation. Worker 1 is responsible for unloading and initially sorting received boxes in Areas 1 and 2, frequently moving items and waste between operational zones and the Waste Area. Worker 2 collects sorted boxes from Area 2, placing them onto assigned storage shelves or returning them for re-inspection or dispatch via Area 4, regularly accessing both high-traffic storage regions and operational areas. Simultaneously, an autonomous robot retrieves an item from Large Shelf 1 and moves it along a pathway crossing major corridors to Area 4. Both workers often occupy or pass through the robot’s route and shared pathways, resulting in frequent, dynamic congestion. The robot, operating entirely autonomously and without any direct human interaction, pauses or reroutes as needed in response to physical obstructions created by the workers' activities or objects temporarily blocking its waypoints. This scenario replicates real-world warehouse pressure where human and robotic workflows overlap and influence each other solely through environmental presence and activity."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**Cyclic Task Sequence Design and Reasoning**

---

### Worker 1: Receiving & Initial Sorting Specialist

**Task Sequence:**
1. **Boxes 1 → Area 1**  
   *Retrieve incoming boxes from Boxes 1 and transport them to Area 1 for initial sorting.*

2. **Area 1 → Area 2**  
   *After sorting in Area 1, move sorted, ready-for-storage or dispatch items to Area 2.*

3. **Area 2 → Waste Area**  
   *Collect empty packaging or unusable materials from Area 2 (leftover from sorting) and deliver them to the Waste Area.*

4. **Waste Area → Boxes 1**  
   *Return from the Waste Area to Boxes 1 to start the next cycle of retrieving new incoming boxes.*

**Reasoning:**
- **Boxes 1 → Area 1:** Worker 1’s role is to initiate the process by handling incoming goods; Boxes 1 is the logical start.
- **Area 1 → Area 2:** Sorting occurs in Area 1, after which items for immediate use are moved to Area 2—this supports efficient handoff to Worker 2 and aligns with the operational scenario.
- **Area 2 → Waste Area:** Sorting generates waste, and regular removal is critical to keep the workflow smooth and prevent clutter.
- **Waste Area → Boxes 1:** Returning to Boxes 1 completes the loop, readying Worker 1 for the next batch of incoming goods and maintaining process continuity.

---

### Worker 2: Storage & Relocation Specialist

**Task Sequence:**
1. **Area 2 → Shelf 3 (Region 2)**  
   *Collect items sorted for storage from Area 2 and move them to Shelf 3 for storage (or as assigned by inventory type/priority).*

2. **Shelf 3 → Area 4**  
   *Retrieve specific items (for inspection or further processing) from Shelf 3 and deliver them to Area 4.*

3. **Area 4 → Waste Area**  
   *Collect any damaged, rejected, or excess items identified in Area 4 and take them to the Waste Area.*

4. **Waste Area → Area 2**  
   *Return to Area 2 to pick up the next batch of items for storage or relocation, completing the task loop.*

**Reasoning:**
- **Area 2 → Shelf 3:** Worker 2’s primary job is internal relocation from the sorting area (Area 2) to designated storage (Shelf 3). This maintains storage organization and throughput.
- **Shelf 3 → Area 4:** Retrieval of items for secondary tasks (inspection, dispatch) supports high warehouse reactivity to urgent tasks.
- **Area 4 → Waste Area:** Damaged/unsuitable stock identified during inspection in Area 4 needs prompt removal, preventing backlogs.
- **Waste Area → Area 2:** Returning to Area 2 maximizes efficiency, synchronizing Worker 2’s role with the cyclical nature of warehouse replenishment.

---

**Summary:**  
These sequences are grounded in actual process flow, minimize unnecessary travel, and strategically use each functional area to meet operational needs. Returning each worker to their cycle’s starting point ensures continuous, efficient material handling that both supports the overall operational scenario and increases throughput—all while allowing for indirect environmental interplay between human and robot.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


---

## Worker 1: Receiving & Initial Sorting Specialist

### Step 1: Boxes 1 → Area 1
- **Start:** E1 (Boxes 1)
- **End:** G4 (Area 1)
- **Path:** [E1, F1, G1, G2, G3, G4]

**Explanation:**  
E1 is at the lower-right edge of Boxes 1, close to the main North-South corridor. G4 is a valid entry on the edge of Area 1.  
- G1 and G2 are *invalid*, so this route must be adjusted to avoid them.  
- Alternate route: [E1, E2, E3, F3, G3, G4] (All are valid: E2, E3 in Boxes 1; F3/G3 in Waste Area, then G4 at Area 1.)  
**Corrected Path:** [E1, E2, E3, F3, G3, G4]  
- Edge waypoints E1, E2, E3, F3, G3 are used directly and legally.  
- Route is efficient, hugging the edge and using direct transitions between area-specific waypoints.

---

### Step 2: Area 1 → Area 2
- **Start:** G4 (Area 1)
- **End:** G7 (Area 2)
- **Path:** [G4, G5, G6, G7]

**Explanation:**  
All are valid Area 1/2 waypoints (G4, G5, G6 in Area 1; G7 in both Area 1 and 2).  
- Moves laterally along the G row, edge points used as allowed by the area rules.  
- No obstacles or invalid points are present in this segment.

---

### Step 3: Area 2 → Waste Area
- **Start:** G7 (Area 2)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **Path:** [G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]

**Explanation:**  
All points are valid for their areas; G7 → G3 is a direct, westward route along G row, using only legitimate area entry/exit points.  
- Edge navigation (G7-G3) is the most direct connection to Waste Area, and all points are legal.

---

### Step 4: Waste Area → Boxes 1
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **End:** E1 (Boxes 1)
- **Path:** [G3, F3, E3, E2, E1]

**Explanation:**  
Reverse of Step 1 path; all are valid as previously described.  
- Efficiently returns Worker 1 to the loop start, using edge waypoints for direct movement and avoiding pedestrian congestion in central aisles, as expected for a bulk-movement workflow.

---

## Worker 2: Storage & Relocation Specialist

### Step 1: Area 2 → Shelf 3 (Region 2)
- **Start:** G10 (Area 2)
- **End:** D16 (Shelf 3)
- **Path:** [G10, F10, E10, D10, D12, D14, D16]

**Explanation:**  
G10 is on the right edge of Area 2. D16 is an edge waypoint at the bottom of Shelf 3 (valid for shelf work; alternative could be A16/B16/C16/D16 per Shelf 3's area list).  
- [G10, F10, E10] traces northbound to intersect storage shelf rows.
- D10 is invalid (per instructions). Instead, use E10 → D12 (since D10 is a forbidden point)  
**Alternate Valid Route:**  
[G10, F10, E10, E12, D12, D14, D16]  
- E10 and E12 are both central valid waypoints.  
- Route shifts east (E12) to step around the invalid vertical, then rejoins shelf corridor at D12, and traverses shelf area via valid D14/D16.  
- Efficient access using a mix of center and edge points, and strictly obeys area transitions and invalid point exclusions.

---

### Step 2: Shelf 3 → Area 4
- **Start:** D16 (Shelf 3)
- **End:** H16 (Area 4)
- **Path:** [D16, E16, F16, G16, H16]

**Explanation:**  
D16 is an edge valid storage shelf point. H16 is an edge valid Area 4 point.  
- Straight vertical transition up central warehouse columns (16th column).  
- All points are valid, with smooth area transitions (no jumps or detours required; edge points used as entry/exit).  
- This is the shortest legal route under the rules.

---

### Step 3: Area 4 → Waste Area
- **Start:** H16 (Area 4)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **Path:** [H16, G16, G15, G10, G7, G4, G3]

**Explanation:**  
H16 to G16 (Area 4), then lateral westward along G row, hitting only valid area or corridor points ending at G3 (Waste Area, edge).  
- Waypoints G16 → G15 (both valid for Area 4), then G10 (Area 2), then G7 (Area 2), G4 (Area 1), and finally G3 (Waste Area).
- Efficient diagonal then horizontal return using legal edge transitions, staying out of high-traffic central columns.

---

### Step 4: Waste Area → Area 2
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **End:** G10 (Area 2)
- **Path:** [G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10]

**Explanation:**  
Direct horizontal edge-row movement along G, starting from Waste Area’s edge and entering Area 2 through any designated edge entry.  
- All points are area valid waypoints according to the lists.  
- Ensures Worker 2 re-enters the operational cycle at the same starting point as the next sequence.

---

**Summary of Approach:**  
- Routes explicitly start and end on defined valid waypoints for each warehouse area.
- Edge points are fully utilized as legal start and transfer steps according to rules, especially in conjunction with shelves and storage running along the boundaries.
- All routes were planned to avoid given invalid waypoints; in cases of forced detour (e.g., D10 is invalid) alternate columns/rows are used, but only passing through additional valid area points.
- Paths are direct, leverage low-traffic peripheral waypoints where appropriate, and minimize waypoint count to maintain operational efficiency and throughput—all while supporting dynamic interplay by allowing for indirect congestion and influences that shape robot behavior purely through workers’ actions in the shared space.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16

- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21

For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.

#### **Validation:**
- **Start (G3):** Valid (Waste Area).
- **End (E1):** Valid (Boxes 1).

**Correction Needed:** None.

---

#### **Full-Loop Validation:**  
- **First start (E1) == Final end (E1):** True, forms a closed loop.

---

## Worker 2: Path Validation and Correction

---

### **Step 1: Area 2 → Shelf 3 (Region 2)**  
**Original Path:** [G10, F10, E10, E12, D12, D14, D16]

#### **Validation:**
- **Start (G10):** Valid (Area 2).
- **End (D16):** Valid (Shelf 3).
- **Waypoints:**  
  - G10: Valid for Area 2.
  - F10: Is F10 valid?
    - F10 is not listed as *blocked* for F row.
    - Not specifically listed under Area 2, but it's an acceptable intermediate grid point since F row is a passageway.
  - E10: Not a valid Shelf 3 waypoint, but is a valid transit in main aisles.
  - E12: Not a defined Area Valid Waypoint, but again, it's a grid intersection, part of a passage.
  - D12: **D12 is forbidden** (blocked; D12 is not in the D row valid list except for Shelf 1, Shelf 2, but D12 is listed under Shelf 1 and Shelf 2, not Shelf 3).
  - D14, D16: Both valid for Shelf 3.
- **Check D12:**  
   - D12 is not in the blocked list in the D row (since only D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21 are blocked), so it is **not** invalid.
   - D12 is present as a valid Shelf 1, Shelf 2 point, but not Shelf 3—however, it's a corridor node leading up to Shelf 3.
   - Similarly, E10/E12 are valid for transition but not for storage interaction.
   - **Intermediate waypoints should not be in an area’s specific list unless the worker is interacting with that area**.

**Result:**  
- All waypoints are valid navigation points and not blocked.
- Entering Shelf 3 only at the last three: D14, D16, which are explicitly valid Shelf 3 waypoints.
- The route maintains continuity and does not violate area entry/exit.
- **Correction Needed:** None.

---

### **Step 2: Shelf 3 → Area 4**  
**Original Path:** [D16, E16, F16, G16, H16]

#### **Validation:**
- **Start (D16):** Valid (Shelf 3).
- **End (H16):** Valid (Area 4).
- **Waypoints:**  
  - D16: Valid Shelf 3.
  - E16, F16: Not defined as valid specifically for any area, but they're not blocked and function as corridor/intermediate grid points on the transit path.
  - G16: Valid Area 4 waypoint.
  - H16: Valid Area 4 waypoint.
- **Check for blocked/area-specific constraints:**  
  - E16, F16: Not in blocked list.
  - All transitions are direct—no forbidden points or area misuse.
- **Area 4 entry:** Only the last two waypoints are within Area 4, as required.

**Correction Needed:** None.

---

### **Step 3: Area 4 → Waste Area**  
**Original Path:** [H16, G16, G15, G10, G7, G4, G3]

#### **Validation:**
- **Start (H16):** Valid (Area 4).
- **End (G3):** Valid (Waste Area).
- **Waypoints:**
  - H16: Valid Area 4.
  - G16: Valid Area 4.
  - G15: Valid Area 4.
  - G10: Valid Area 2.
  - G7: Valid Area 2.
  - G4: Valid Area 1.
  - G3: Valid Waste Area.
- **All points are not blocked and are in the respective Area Valid Waypoints lists for each respective functional area.**
- **Path transitions are continuous and logical (moving west along the G row, through valid entry/exit points for each area).**

**Correction Needed:** None.

---

### **Step 4: Waste Area → Area 2**  
**Original Path:** [G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10]

#### **Validation:**
- **Start (G3):** Valid (Waste Area).
- **End (G10):** Valid (Area 2).
- **Waypoints:**
  - G3: Waste Area.
  - G4: Area 1.
  - G5/6: Area 1.
  - G7: Area 1/2.
  - G8/9/10: Area 2.
- **All waypoints are valid for their respective areas and not blocked.**
- **Path transitions are continuous.**

**Correction Needed:** None.

---

#### **Full-Loop Validation:**  
- **First start (G10) == Final end (G10):** True, forms a closed loop for Worker 2.

| Worker 2 Step 3       | None                        | Path valid, no changes       |
| Worker 2 Step 4       | None                        | Path valid, no changes       |

## **Final Verdict:**  
**All previously generated waypoint paths are valid: every segment’s start, end, and intermediate waypoints are permitted, not blocked, area-appropriate, and form continuous, closed loops as required. No corrections are necessary for any segment.**

If edge navigation or area entry/exit becomes more restrictive or if new functional/blocked waypoints are introduced, future corrections should maintain explicit adherence to the area-specific lists and corridor strategy demonstrated here.

You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
