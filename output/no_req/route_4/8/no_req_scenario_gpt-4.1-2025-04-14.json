  "scenario": "During a morning shift in a logistic warehouse, Worker 1 is tasked with restocking items from bulk storage boxes in Region 1 to shelves in Region 2 and organizing new arrivals in Region 3 (Areas 1 and 2) while periodically discarding waste packaging. Simultaneously, Worker 2 retrieves items from Large Shelf 1 in Region 4 for order fulfillment, transports them to Area 4 in Region 3 for inspection and sorting, then moves staged orders to Area 5 for outbound dispatch using the pallet jack. An autonomous robot, operating solely on environmental sensing, starts at Large Shelf 1 (M5), picks up an item, and follows a path through shared corridors and operational zones, delivering the item to Area 4 (H17). Throughout the scenario, workers move across overlapping grid pathways and operational zones, sometimes occupying or blocking the robot’s planned route as they handle goods, move equipment, or leave staging bins, requiring the robot to pause, slow, or reroute based solely on real-time environmental conditions—resulting in frequent, indirect human-robot interaction without direct communication.",
