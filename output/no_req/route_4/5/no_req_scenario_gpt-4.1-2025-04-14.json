  "scenario": "A shipment of large boxes arrives at Area 5, initiating a high-activity workflow. Worker 1 receives the shipment using the pallet jack, transporting incoming goods to Large Shelf 1 and sometimes directly to Areas 1 or 2 for urgent items. While performing rough sorting and waste removal, Worker 1 makes frequent trips between Area 5, Large Shelf 1, and the Waste Area, often occupying corridors near grid points M5–L9. Concurrently, Worker 2 inspects and processes items, moving between Large Shelf 1, Areas 1 and 2 for inspection, and then restaging cleared items in Area 4 for subsequent dispatch, with some rejected goods sent to the Waste Area. Both workers often occupy overlapping spaces and cause temporary obstructions in the main corridors, resulting in the autonomous robot—tasked with relocating material from Large Shelf 1 (M5) to Area 4 (H17)—occasionally stopping, rerouting, or waiting for its intended path to clear. All interactions are indirect and due solely to the evolving warehouse environment, reflecting a realistic, high-throughput scenario with independently operating agents.",
