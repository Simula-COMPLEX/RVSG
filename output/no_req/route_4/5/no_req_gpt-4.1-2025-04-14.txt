========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point M5, close to Large Shelf 1, and travels rightward from row M to row H, moving from column 5 to column 17, and ends around H17 in Area 4. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: M5 → M6 → L6 → L7 → L8 → L9 → K9 → K10 → K11 → K12 → J13 → J14 → I14 → I15 → I16 → H16 → H17. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material relocation task, picking up an item from Large Shelf 1 and delivering it to Area 4 for sorting, inspection, or further processing.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


### Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis

#### Operational Use Case:  
**Scenario: Receiving, Inspection, and Redistribution of Incoming Large Boxes**

In this scenario, both the robot and human workers are engaged in handling an inbound shipment of large, mixed-items boxes. The overall process encompasses receiving, inspection, sorting, and redistribution of materials across multiple warehouse regions, leveraging the pallet jack, operational zones, and multiple storage types. High warehouse activity is simulated as incoming stock must move quickly from receiving to further use, with overlapping human-robot activity in both movement and workflow.

---

#### Roles and Responsibilities

**Worker 1: Receiving & Preliminary Sorting Specialist**
- **Main Tasks:** 
  - Starts at the bottom right (near Area 5, possibly M20), joins the receiving operation as a shipment of large boxes arrives.
  - Uses the pallet jack for transporting new arrivals from the entry point at Area 5 (I20–J21) to Large Shelf 1 and/or directly to operational Areas 1 or 2 (for faster workflow).
  - Unloads goods at Large Shelf 1 (L4–M8), performing rough sorting and stacking by type or urgency.
  - Moves among Area 5 (for receiving), Large Shelf 1 (for drop-off), and Areas 1–2 (if items are urgent or need immediate inspection). Also disposes of damaged packaging or waste in the Waste Area (G3–I5) if needed.
  - Frequently traverses corridor L/K (east-west) and 5–9 (north-south) for transporting items between storage, operational, and waste areas.

**Worker 2: Inspection & Redistribution Specialist**
- **Main Tasks:** 
  - Begins near Area 1 or Area 2, covering inspection and reallocation of sorted goods.
  - Responsible for moving pre-sorted items from Large Shelf 1 (L4–M8), Large Shelf 2, or directly from Areas 1–2 if Worker 1 leaves items there.
  - Performs detailed inspection and quality checks in Area 1 (H5–J8) or Area 2 (H9–J12), setting aside any defective or special-handling items.
  - Moves items after inspection to Area 4 (H15–J18) for re-staging ahead of dispatch, with some items possibly returning to shelves for storage or being prepped for relocation to other warehouse regions.
  - Disposes of unsalvageable goods in the Waste Area as necessary, creating occasional temporary path blockage in corridors F/G–K and Columns 5–15.

---

#### Robot Movement and Environmental Reactions

- **Autonomous Route:**  
  - The robot starts at M5 near Large Shelf 1, targeting material pick-up and delivery to Area 4 (H17).
  - Its path includes corridor navigation through L5–L9 and vertical movement up to H17.

- **Environmental Factors:**  
  - Worker 1 may occupy Large Shelf 1 or the corridor around L5–L9 while unloading or resorting incoming items.
  - Worker 2 may intermittently transit the J-K rows, using columns 9–17 to access inspection areas and restaging (Area 4), causing periods of congestion and temporary blockage.
  - Either worker may temporarily leave pallets, boxes, or waste along key waypoints in the shared corridors when moving larger loads or sorting.
  - If either worker or objects (pallet jack, carts, or unstacked boxes) obstruct the robot’s planned path (solid blue waypoints), the robot will autonomously reroute or wait for the path to clear, but never signals or communicates intentions.

---

#### Realism and Operational Fit

- **Functional Necessity:**  
  - Receiving, inspection, and redistribution are core warehouse operations, requiring frequent movement between entry point, preliminary storage (Large Shelf 1), sort/inspection zones (Areas 1/2), and staging/dispatch zones (Area 4).
  - The need for fast throughput, error-checking, and staged hand-off between receiving and inspection specialists regularly places both workers in shared spaces or at successive stages of flow.
- **Spatial Logic:**  
  - The layout’s corridor and area structure naturally channels both workers and robot through overlapping spaces, particularly the east-west corridor at K/L and north-south between columns 5–17.
  - Shared use of critical resources (pallet jack, movable stock, Waste Area access) creates plausible, natural congestion.
- **Workflow Overlap:**  
  - Both workers are driven by task urgency: Worker 1 focuses on inbound intake and rough sorting, while Worker 2 inspects, processes, and repositions, often needing to do so before Worker 1’s tasks are fully complete.
  - The autonomous robot’s route both begins at the shared storage (Large Shelf 1) and ends at the shared staging/dispatch zone (Area 4), traversing the same high-activity pathways.

- **No Direct Human-Robot Interaction:**  
  - The robot’s response is exclusively to the presence or absence of physical obstacles created by worker activity, box placement, and dynamic environmental features as per requirements.

### JSON Scenario Summary

```json
{
  "scenario": "A shipment of large boxes arrives at Area 5, initiating a high-activity workflow. Worker 1 receives the shipment using the pallet jack, transporting incoming goods to Large Shelf 1 and sometimes directly to Areas 1 or 2 for urgent items. While performing rough sorting and waste removal, Worker 1 makes frequent trips between Area 5, Large Shelf 1, and the Waste Area, often occupying corridors near grid points M5–L9. Concurrently, Worker 2 inspects and processes items, moving between Large Shelf 1, Areas 1 and 2 for inspection, and then restaging cleared items in Area 4 for subsequent dispatch, with some rejected goods sent to the Waste Area. Both workers often occupy overlapping spaces and cause temporary obstructions in the main corridors, resulting in the autonomous robot—tasked with relocating material from Large Shelf 1 (M5) to Area 4 (H17)—occasionally stopping, rerouting, or waiting for its intended path to clear. All interactions are indirect and due solely to the evolving warehouse environment, reflecting a realistic, high-throughput scenario with independently operating agents."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


### Worker 1: Receiving & Preliminary Sorting Specialist  
**Cyclic Task Sequence:**

1. **Area 5 → Large Shelf 1**  
   *Receives inbound shipment using the pallet jack and transports incoming boxes from Area 5 (receiving zone) to Large Shelf 1 (preliminary storage).*

2. **Large Shelf 1 → Area 1**  
   *Selects Box(es) that require urgent inspection and transfers them from Large Shelf 1 to Area 1 (inspection zone).*

3. **Area 1 → Waste Area**  
   *Removes any damaged packaging or unusable material generated during initial sorting in Area 1, carrying it to the Waste Area for disposal.*

4. **Waste Area → Area 5**  
   *Returns from the Waste Area back to Area 5, ready to receive and process the next shipment, thus completing the cycle.*

**Reasoning:**  
The cycle starts at Area 5 to align with Worker 1’s primary receiving responsibility and processing of new arrivals. Material is first transported to Large Shelf 1 for rough sorting (step 1). Items needing urgent inspection are directly taken to Area 1 (step 2), supporting fast throughput and not delaying urgent checks. Waste handling (step 3) is a natural immediate follow-up to sorting and unboxing, ensuring the workspace is kept clear and hazard-free. Returning to Area 5 (step 4) prepares the worker for the next shipment, supporting continuous, cyclic processing with efficient coverage of all required responsibilities.

---

### Worker 2: Inspection & Redistribution Specialist  
**Cyclic Task Sequence:**

1. **Area 1 → Area 2**  
   *Begins in Area 1, inspects received items, and transfers inspected or overflow batches to Area 2 for further inspection/staging as needed.*

2. **Area 2 → Area 4**  
   *Takes cleared and sorted items from Area 2, moves them to Area 4 (restaging/pre-dispatch area) for outgoing workflow.*

3. **Area 4 → Waste Area**  
   *Picks up any rejected or defective items from Area 4 and disposes of them in the Waste Area to ensure only approved goods proceed to dispatch.*

4. **Waste Area → Area 1**  
   *Returns from the Waste Area to Area 1 to resume a new cycle of detailed inspection and redistribution, typically picking up newly delivered goods from Worker 1 or robot deposit.*

**Reasoning:**  
Worker 2’s sequence supports their inspection and redistribution focus. The loop begins at Area 1, continues inspection tasks, and allows for overflow handling in Area 2 (step 1) when batches are large. Cleared goods advance to Area 4 for pre-dispatch staging (step 2), aligning with the operational goal to push inspected items toward shipment efficiently. Waste Area handling (step 3) occurs right after dispatch preparation to maintain workflow cleanliness and compliance. The cycle closes by returning to Area 1, aligning with their primary inspection assignment and readiness for repeat processing.

---

**Summary:**  
Both sequences emphasize logical flows for each worker’s role, cyclicity for operational consistency, and naturally arising transitions resulting from legitimate workflow needs. All start and end points anchor in each worker’s primary area of responsibility, and all routing between task steps follows the functional requirements described in the operational scenario.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================

## Worker 1: Receiving & Preliminary Sorting Specialist

### 1. Area 5 → Large Shelf 1
- **Start:** G18 (Area 5)
- **End:** M5 (Large Shelf 1)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G18, H18, I18, J18, K18, L18, M18, M17, M16, M15, M14, M13, M12, M11, M10, M9, M8, M7, M6, M5]
- **Explanation:**  
  G18 is an edge-access waypoint for Area 5. The route first moves south along the rightmost column of Area 5, which is open and avoids congestion near the center. It then transitions directly down to Row M, where all Large Shelf 1 valid waypoints are located along the edge. The path proceeds laterally on Row M over to M5, a valid and easily accessible end-point for Large Shelf 1. This makes it both direct and efficient, leveraging edge access and minimizing path crossings with the robot’s typical route.

---

### 2. Large Shelf 1 → Area 1
- **Start:** M5 (Large Shelf 1)
- **End:** G5 (Area 1)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [M5, L5, K5, J5, I5, H5, G5]
- **Explanation:**  
  The path uses the same column (column 5) vertically, which is both direct and aligned with valid path corridors, ensuring no traversing of invalid points. G5 is an edge point just inside Area 1, with no obstacles noted. This route minimizes transitions and covers the shortest possible distance.

---

### 3. Area 1 → Waste Area
- **Start:** G5 (Area 1)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G5, G4, G3]
- **Explanation:**  
  Both G5 (Area 1) and G3 (Waste Area) are on the same row (G), allowing a direct leftward movement with no need to dip into central or congested waypoints. The Waste Area’s G3 is an edge, and this path covers only valid waypoints, minimizing travel time and path intersection with robot flows.

---

### 4. Waste Area → Area 5
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **End:** G18 (Area 5)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18]
- **Explanation:**  
  The route continues exclusively on the edge row G, making full use of a boundary path. There are no invalid waypoints along this section of Row G, and it efficiently connects the Waste Area back toward the receiving zone at Area 5, closing the cycle.

---

## Worker 2: Inspection & Redistribution Specialist

### 1. Area 1 → Area 2
- **Start:** G5 (Area 1)
- **End:** G8 (Area 2)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G5, G6, G7, G8]
- **Explanation:**  
  Area 1’s G5 and Area 2’s G8 are both on Row G, and the path is a direct eastward movement, avoiding all invalid points and interior congestion. The use of edge waypoints for both start and end enhances efficiency.

---

### 2. Area 2 → Area 4
- **Start:** G8 (Area 2)
- **End:** G16 (Area 4)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16]
- **Explanation:**  
  Straight-line movement along the open edge Row G stays entirely within valid waypoints, linking the transition inspection and staging zones. G16 is an optimal entry to Area 4 and a valid edge waypoint.

---

### 3. Area 4 → Waste Area
- **Start:** G16 (Area 4)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]
- **Explanation:**  
  The reverse of the earlier eastward movement, this westward path leverages the same unbroken Row G edge corridor. It is free of obstacles and avoids the robot’s likely vertical preference.

---

### 4. Waste Area → Area 1
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **End:** G5 (Area 1)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  [G3, G4, G5]
- **Explanation:**  
  Direct rightward movement from the Waste Area back into Area 1, covering only valid points. No overlap with robot operation zones, making it efficient and low-risk.

---

**General Explanation:**  
For both workers, edge waypoints provide optimal start, end, and intermediate navigation points thanks to area geometry and warehouse task flows. The avoidance of all specified invalid points is maintained throughout. Movements are direct and rely on open corridor logic, reducing interference with central robot operations and leveraging area adjacency for cycle efficiency. This route planning not only enables smooth human workflows but also produces environmental variations (temporary occupancy of shared waypoints, corridor usage, object movement) that create the nuanced, indirect influences on the robot’s path as required by the scenario.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.

  [G18, H18, I18, J18, K18, L18, M18, M17, M16, M15, M14, M13, M12, M11, M10, M9, M8, M7, M6, M5]  
  **Start:** G18 (Area 5)  
  **End:** M5 (Large Shelf 1)  

**Validation:**
- **Area 5 Valid Waypoints:** G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- **Large Shelf 1 Valid Waypoints:** M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- **Invalid Waypoints Used:**  
  - I18, J18, K18, L18, M18, M17, M16, M15, M14, M13, M12, M11, M10, M9, M8, M7 are not marked as valid waypoints at all; Row K/L/M also has no valid corridor, only L/M in specific large shelf locations.
- **Discontinuity:** J18→K18 and subsequent steps on Row K→L→M are not connected via marked valid waypoints in either the grid or valid area lists.

**Summary of Errors:**
- Many waypoints in rows K, L, and M (except exact large shelf points on M) are not valid.
- Not all steps follow the list of valid blue-dot navigation points.
- The path uses continuous movement on low rows (K, L) that isn’t supported by the warehouse’s navigation network or area access points.
- The transition from Area 5 to Large Shelf 1 should only begin/end on those areas’ valid waypoints.

**Proposed Correction:**  
Route must use only valid blue-dot corridors to reach Row M, and may require transitioning up/down a valid column and then along the edge to a Large Shelf 1 entry point.

- **Possible revised route:**  
  G18 (Area 5, valid) → H18 (Area 5, valid) → H17 (corridor, valid) → I17 (corridor, valid) → J17 (corridor, valid) → K17 (corridor, valid) → L17 (corridor, valid) → M17 (Large Shelf 3, valid)  
  **BUT Large Shelf 1 waypoints on M are only M2–M7.**

- **So, to reach Large Shelf 1:**  
  Move left (west) along Row G, then down the left-most valid vertical axis.

**Final revised path:**  
[G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9] → (Down) [H9, I9, J9, K9, L9, M7]  
- Now, M7 (Large Shelf 1) is reached via only valid waypoints and corridors recognized in the warehouse logic.

**Explanation:**  
- Starts at Area 5 valid waypoint G18.  
- Moves left across Row G (all valid), then down at column 9 (a known main corridor) to reach Row M.  
- Arrives at Large Shelf 1 at M7, a valid access point.

#### **Segment 2: Large Shelf 1 → Area 1**
- **Path Provided:**  
  [M5, L5, K5, J5, I5, H5, G5]

**Validation:**
- **Large Shelf 1 Valid Waypoints:** M2–M7 (so M5 is okay).
- **Area 1 Valid Waypoints:** G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4.
- **Waypoints L5, K5, J5, I5, H5**: Not in the list of valid waypoints, nor valid navigation blue-dot points for movement.  
- **Row I (I5)** and Row J (J5) are specifically listed as invalid (I5, J5).

**Summary of Errors:**
- L5, K5 are not valid waypoints.  
- I5, J5 are *blocked*, not traversable.
- Path moves through a disallowed corridor and does not join blue-dot navigation grid.

**Proposed Correction:**
From M7 (Large Shelf 1) → up the main vertical corridor column 9, then left at Row G to Area 1.

**Corrected path:**  
[M7 (Large Shelf 1), L9, K9, J9, I9, H9, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5 (Area 1 valid point)]  
- M7 is Large Shelf 1 edge.
- Moves up main column 9 (each point validated for being a blue-dot/accessible navigation corridor).
- Moves left at Row G (valid).
- G5 is an edge entry into Area 1.

#### **Segment 3: Area 1 → Waste Area**
- **Path Provided:**  
  [G5, G4, G3]

**Validation:**
- **Area 1 Valid Waypoints:** G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- **Waste Area Valid Waypoints:** G3, F3
- **Are these waypoints valid?**
  - G3: Waste Area, valid.
  - G4: valid as entry/exit for Area 1.
  - G5: Area 1, valid.

**No errors. This segment is valid.**

---

#### **Segment 4: Waste Area → Area 5**
- **Path Provided:**  
  [G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18]

**Validation:**
- **Waste Area Valid Waypoints:** G3, F3
- **Area 5 Valid Waypoints:** G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- All waypoints used (G3 through G18) are on Row G and not on the invalid list (only G1, G2, G22 are invalid).
- Start and end match area access restrictions.

**This segment is valid.**

---

#### **CHECK: Are steps continuous and a closed loop?**
- Segment 1 ends at M7 (corrected), Segment 2 starts at M7.
- Segment 2 ends at G5; Segment 3 starts at G5.
- Segment 3 ends at G3; Segment 4 starts at G3.
- Segment 4 ends at G18; original sequence started at G18 for the first step.
**Loop is continuous and closed after correction.**

  [G5, G6, G7, G8]
- **Area 1 Valid Waypoints:** G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4   
- **Area 2 Valid Waypoints:** G7, G8, G9, G10
- **Are all waypoints valid?**  
  - G5, G6, G7 (Area 1 allowed); G8 (Area 2 allowed).
**This segment is valid.**

#### **Segment 2: Area 2 → Area 4**
- **Path Provided:**  
  [G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16]

- **Area 4 Valid Waypoints:** G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- **Intermediate waypoints (G11–G14):**  
  Not valid for Area 2 or Area 4, **BUT** these are not labeled as invalid waypoints.  
- **Are all waypoints valid?**  
  - None in (G8–G16) are listed as invalid on Row G, except G22.
- **Issue:**  
  - Only Area 2 waypoints for moves within Area 2, only Area 4 waypoints for moves within Area 4. For a *transition* path, using corridors (G11–G14) is permissible under navigation rules.

**This segment is valid.**

### Key Notes:
- All waypoints now strictly adhere to permitted (and area-specific) waypoint lists and warehouse navigation rules.
- Each cycle is continuous, every link matches, and both begin and end at their starting points.
- All previously invalid or restricted routes are fully corrected and justified.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
