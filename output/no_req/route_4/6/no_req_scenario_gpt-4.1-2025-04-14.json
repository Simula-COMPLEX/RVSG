  "scenario": "During a mid-shift inbound receiving operation, Worker 1 receives, inspects, and sorts new deliveries in Region 3’s Areas 1 and 2, moving approved goods to Area 4 or rejected items to the Waste Area. Worker 2 concurrently collects sorted stock from Area 4 and Areas 3 for storage on Region 4’s Large Shelves, returning to operational zones to repeat the process as needed. Both workers regularly cross paths in the staging, inspection, and main corridor zones, at times causing temporary obstructions or congestion—especially at Area 4 and central corridors. The autonomous robot simultaneously relocates bulk items from Large Shelf 1 to Area 4, pausing or rerouting only when human workers or their equipment physically block its navigational waypoints, responding solely to environmental changes without any direct communication or commands.",
