  "scenario": "During a high-volume receiving period, Worker 1 unloads and sorts inbound goods at Large Shelf 1, moving select cartons to sorting Areas 1 and 2 and replenishing shelves in Region 2. Worker 2 inspects and sorts items in Areas 1 and 2, transferring passed goods to Area 4 for inspection/dispatch and failed goods to the Waste Area. Both workers frequently cross the central pathways and stage items in shared operational areas, creating dynamic congestion. Meanwhile, the autonomous robot moves a carton from Large Shelf 1 to Area 4, pausing or rerouting only when workers or objects temporarily block its navigation route, with all robot actions triggered solely by changes in the environment.",
