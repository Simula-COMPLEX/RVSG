  "scenario": "During a midday restocking and inbound sorting phase, a robot begins at Large Shelf 1 (M5) to transport a package to Area 4 (H17) for inspection or dispatch staging. Worker 1 receives and sorts inbound boxes from Area 5 to Areas 1 and 2, and restocks Shelves 3–4, frequently crossing main corridors. Worker 2 transfers bulky items between Large Shelf 1/2, Area 4, and Area 5, retrieving and storing inventory as needed. Both workers' tasks overlap with the robot's route near Area 4 and along primary corridor waypoints, creating dense, dynamic traffic and frequent temporary blockages. The robot autonomously pauses or reroutes only when its planned path is obstructed by worker activity or material placement, ensuring fully indirect, environment-based responses without direct communication.",
