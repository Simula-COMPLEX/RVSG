  "scenario": "Following a morning delivery, Worker A unloads and sorts inbound goods at Area 1, transferring damaged items to the Waste Area. Meanwhile, Worker B performs detailed inspection in Area 2, stages approved items in Area 3, and replenishes Shelf 6 using the central corridor and occasionally the pallet jack. The autonomous robot moves from Area 3 to Shelf 6 along the F-row corridor, transporting staged goods for storage. High-activity periods involve both workers frequently occupying shared pathways and operational zones, especially in Areas 1-3 and along Row F near Shelf 6. The robot dynamically pauses or re-routes only in response to physical obstacles or occupation—such as when workers deposit, retrieve, or inspect goods in its path—ensuring continuous operation without direct human-robot interaction.",
