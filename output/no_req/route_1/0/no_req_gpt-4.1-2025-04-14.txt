========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point G12 in Area 3, and travels rightward from row G to row E, moving from column 12 to column 21, and ends around E21 near Shelf 6. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: G12 → F12 → F13 → F14 → F15 → F16 → F17 → F18 → E18 → E19 → E20 → E21. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material transport task, picking up an item from Area 3 and delivering it to Shelf 6 for storage or replenishment.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis:**

### Operational Use Case: "Receiving, Quality Inspection, and Storage Replenishment"

#### Context:
The warehouse is experiencing a period of high activity following a morning delivery, requiring both immediate processing of incoming stock and replenishment of frequently accessed shelf inventory. Two human workers (Worker A and Worker B) are collaborating to manage the influx. Meanwhile, an autonomous robot is tasked with transferring pre-inspected items from Area 3 to Shelf 6 for storage, following the navigation route provided.

#### Worker Assignments & Workflow:

**Worker A: Receiving and Preliminary Sorting**
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Unloads new deliveries from the inbound dock (off-layout location, accessed via the central corridor near Region 4).
  - Transports received items to **Region 3: Area 1**, using the main pathway at row K, columns 1–9.
  - Performs a quick visual inspection for obvious damage or mislabeling.
  - Sorts items based on type: items passing initial inspection remain in **Area 1**; questionable/damaged goods are moved to the **Waste Area (Region 3: F–J, 1–4)**.
- **Movement Pattern:**  
  - Frequently moves between **Area 1**, the **Waste Area**, and the inbound access corridor near **Large Shelf 1 (Region 4)**.
- **Workflow Justification:**  
  - This split between receiving and waste management is typical for high-throughput facilities where sorting and rejection must occur close to the receiving point to avoid workflow bottlenecks.

**Worker B: Quality Inspection and Shelf Replenishment**
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Selects pre-sorted goods from **Area 1** after Worker A’s initial processing.
  - Transfers these items to **Area 2** for detailed inspection and scanning/barcode verification.
  - Moves approved stock to **Area 3**, staging items for storage or immediate order picking.
  - When shelf stock levels are low, Worker B carries batches from **Area 3** down the central corridor (F-row, columns 9–21), placing them on shelves in **Region 2, Shelf 6**. At times, Worker B may use the **pallet jack (G–H, 22)** to facilitate bulk transfers, returning it to its dock after use.
- **Movement Pattern:**  
  - Regularly traverses from **Area 1→Area 2→Area 3**; also moves to the **pallet jack** in G–H, 22, and makes trips to **Shelf 6** as required for replenishment.
- **Workflow Justification:**  
  - Consolidating inspection, staging, and replenishment roles ensures rapid cycle time from receiving to shelf storage, minimizing dwell time for high-turnover stock.

#### Overlapping Activity & Environmental Complexity:
- Both workers have overlapping tasks in **Areas 1 and 2** (Region 3), where they may simultaneously access sorting or inspection spaces.
- **Area 3** acts as an operational nexus: it is both the robot’s initial waypoint and a shared buffer for staged items being retrieved or delivered by either worker.
- **Shared Pathways:** Both Worker B and the robot use the main corridor (Row F, Columns 12–21) between **Area 3** and **Shelf 6**. The pallet jack is also stored adjacent to this path, causing occasional congestion.
- High-frequency transitions between areas by both workers may lead to temporary occupation of the same space as the robot’s path, such as Worker B depositing goods onto Shelf 6 while the robot arrives via E18–E21, or Worker A crossing F-row while managing waste or retrieving items.

#### Robot Behavior (Environmental Response):
- The robot starts at **G12** (within Area 3) and waits if Worker B is actively sorting/staging in Area 3, or if objects are temporarily left in its path.
- As the robot moves rightward along **Row F** toward **Shelf 6**, it may encounter Worker B transferring items to Shelf 6 or Worker A crossing the corridor. The robot’s obstacle sensors cause it to pause or re-route as needed, based solely on detected obstructions—not on any verbal or direct nonverbal cues from workers.
- At **E18–E21**, if Worker B is placing stock on Shelf 6, the robot again waits until the immediate shelf access point is clear, maintaining task flow without coordination.

#### Operational Realism and Alignment:
- **Workflow Validity:** All activities described are standard in logistics and warehouse management, particularly in multistage receiving and replenishment operations.
- **Role Complementarity:** Worker A manages incoming flow, triage, and disposal; Worker B ensures quality assurance and transfer to forward stock locations. Both must use and access shared zones, fitting normal high-activity warehouse practice.
- **Environmental Influence on Robot:** The robot navigates autonomously and only pauses, reroutes, or resumes in response to actual (not anticipated or communicated) environmental changes. This fits modern depictions of shared-space robotics where safety and dynamic planning rely on robust perception, not human-robot dialogue.
- **Spatial and Timing Crossovers:** High spatial and temporal overlap is built-in, especially along the F-row corridor, at Area 3, and at Shelf 6.

**JSON Scenario Summary:**
```json
{
  "scenario": "Following a morning delivery, Worker A unloads and sorts inbound goods at Area 1, transferring damaged items to the Waste Area. Meanwhile, Worker B performs detailed inspection in Area 2, stages approved items in Area 3, and replenishes Shelf 6 using the central corridor and occasionally the pallet jack. The autonomous robot moves from Area 3 to Shelf 6 along the F-row corridor, transporting staged goods for storage. High-activity periods involve both workers frequently occupying shared pathways and operational zones, especially in Areas 1-3 and along Row F near Shelf 6. The robot dynamically pauses or re-routes only in response to physical obstacles or occupation—such as when workers deposit, retrieve, or inspect goods in its path—ensuring continuous operation without direct human-robot interaction."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**Worker A: Cyclic Task Sequence and Reasoning**

**Task Sequence:**
1. **Boxes 1 → Area 1**: Collect newly received goods from bulk Boxes 1 storage and deposit them in Area 1 for initial staging.
2. **Area 1 → Waste Area**: Inspect items in Area 1; transfer any damaged or non-conforming goods to the Waste Area for disposal.
3. **Waste Area → Boxes 1**: Return from the Waste Area to Boxes 1 to begin the new cycle of unloading and transfer.

**Reasoning:**
- **Boxes 1 → Area 1**: Worker A starts at Boxes 1, which is the bulk receiving point for newly delivered goods. Transporting goods from Boxes 1 to Area 1 ensures a steady supply of items for the subsequent inspection and sorting steps. Area 1 serves as the first operational staging point, which aligns with Worker A’s responsibilities for unloading and initial handling.
- **Area 1 → Waste Area**: After staging goods in Area 1, Worker A performs initial visual checks. Moving rejected or damaged items to the Waste Area keeps the primary workflow zones uncluttered and supports material quality control.
- **Waste Area → Boxes 1**: Returning to Boxes 1 completes the loop, ensuring Worker A is ready to continue the receiving/unloading process and maintain a continuous flow of materials into the warehouse.

---

**Worker B: Cyclic Task Sequence and Reasoning**

**Task Sequence:**
1. **Area 1 → Area 2**: Collect items ready for inspection from Area 1 and move them to Area 2 for detailed inspection.
2. **Area 2 → Area 3**: Transfer inspected and approved items from Area 2 to Area 3 for staging before shelving or order picking.
3. **Area 3 → Shelf 6**: Carry batches of staged goods from Area 3 along the central corridor and replenish inventory at Shelf 6.
4. **Shelf 6 → Area 1**: Return from Shelf 6 to Area 1 to start the next inspection cycle.

**Reasoning:**
- **Area 1 → Area 2**: Worker B begins at Area 1, collecting items prepared by Worker A. Moving items to Area 2 facilitates uninterrupted quality inspection in a designated zone.
- **Area 2 → Area 3**: Approved goods are moved into Area 3, a key operational nexus that supports both short-term staging and readiness for storage or dispatch. This step aligns with the operational goal of rapid, quality-assured throughput.
- **Area 3 → Shelf 6**: Replenishing Shelf 6 with approved, staged stock matches Worker B’s role in maintaining adequate shelf quantities for picking or further warehouse operations, ensuring no interruption to downstream fulfillment.
- **Shelf 6 → Area 1**: Returning to Area 1 prepares Worker B to pick up the next batch of items marked for inspection, sustaining the cycle of inspection and replenishment.

---

**Summary of Reasoning:**
- Each worker’s sequence supports continuous material movement and role-specific duties, keeping key areas (Area 1, Waste Area, Area 2, Area 3, Shelf 6) active and synchronized with the operational flow.
- The cyclic design ensures no bottlenecks; each step naturally feeds the next, and both workers frequently traverse shared operational zones, supporting dynamic warehouse activity and close functional integration without direct communication.
- These task cycles maintain high overall process efficiency and maximize overlap and throughput in critical, high-traffic regions, fulfilling the operational scenario’s goals.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


### Worker A: Detailed Waypoint-Based Movement Paths

#### Task 1: **Boxes 1 → Area 1**

- **Start coordinate:** E1 *(Boxes 1, edge/side access)*
- **End coordinate:** G4 *(Area 1, edge waypoint)*
- **Full path:**  
  [E1, F1, F2, F3, F4, G4]  
  *(Note: F1 and F2 are invalid, so adjust route)*  
  Instead, route must avoid F1, F2 (invalid):
- **Adjusted Full path:**  
  [E1, E2, E3, F3, G3, G4]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Starts at E1 (Boxes 1, leftmost storage), moves along edge E-row to E3, connecting with the valid F3 (Waste Area, but used only as a passing point), then descends to G3, which is a valid Area 1 neighbor, then right to G4 (Area 1 proper).  
  - This maximizes use of edge points (E1, E3, G3) and avoids invalid F1, F2 waypoints.  
  - Chosen for direct, efficient left-to-central access while respecting all rules.

---

#### Task 2: **Area 1 → Waste Area**

- **Start coordinate:** G4 *(Area 1, edge point)*
- **End coordinate:** G3 *(Waste Area, next edge point left)*
- **Full path:**  
  [G4, G3]
- **Explanation:**  
  - G4 and G3 are adjacent and on the edge; direct path requires lateral move left.  
  - Extremely efficient, using only valid area waypoints and the shortest possible route in the shared operational region.

---

#### Task 3: **Waste Area → Boxes 1**

- **Start coordinate:** G3 *(Waste Area)*
- **End coordinate:** E1 *(Boxes 1, edge point)*
- **Full path:**  
  [G3, F3, E3, E2, E1]  
  *(Inverse of the adjusted route for Task 1)*
- **Explanation:**  
  - Traverses up along column 3 to F3, then E3, using edge waypoints at each step.  
  - Moves directly back to E1 via E2, minimizing corridor overlap and avoiding central congestion.  
  - Utilizes edge points to efficiently return to the receiving zone with no risk of crossing into invalid zones.

---

### Worker B: Detailed Waypoint-Based Movement Paths

#### Task 1: **Area 1 → Area 2**

- **Start coordinate:** G4 *(Area 1, edge point shared with Worker A)*
- **End coordinate:** G7 *(Area 2, left-most valid entry)*
- **Full path:**  
  [G4, G5, G6, G7]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Moves laterally right along valid G-row (all points listed are valid for Area 1 or Area 2).  
  - No vertical movement required.  
  - Uses contiguous edge waypoints for a simple, direct move between adjacent working areas.

---

#### Task 2: **Area 2 → Area 3**

- **Start coordinate:** G7 *(Area 2)*
- **End coordinate:** G12 *(Area 3, leftmost valid arrival, also robot’s “start” endpoint)*
- **Full path:**  
  [G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Linear horizontal movement across G-row, passing fully through specified Area 2 and Area 3 entry points.  
  - G-row offers uninterrupted, valid traversal across these operational zones, with no invalid waypoints in this range.  
  - Efficient for moving inspected stock directly to staging, ready for robot or further human processing.

---

#### Task 3: **Area 3 → Shelf 6**

- **Start coordinate:** G12 *(Area 3)*
- **End coordinate:** A22 *(Shelf 6, edge-top waypoint)*
- **Full path:**  
  [G12, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12, A12, A14, A16, A18, A20, A22]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Ascends vertically from G12 up the 12th column, then takes the top row (A-row) rightwards across the warehouse edge to reach A22.  
  - A12, A14, A16, A18, A20, and A22 are all valid Shelf 6 waypoints—path uses edge points as required.  
  - Using A-row edge waypoints minimizes cross-traffic with workers and the robot, especially during periods of high activity on central corridors (like F-row).
  - Path avoids all listed invalid A-row points, since A12, A14, ..., A22 are valid for shelves.

---

#### Task 4: **Shelf 6 → Area 1**

- **Start coordinate:** A22 *(Shelf 6, edge-top right)*
- **End coordinate:** G4 *(Area 1)*
- **Full path:**  
  [A22, B22, C22, D22, E22, F21, G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Descends from A22 through the edge (B22–D22), then diagonally cuts downward to G21 (part of the Area 5 boundary) and returns left along the G-row to G4 (Area 1).
  - This uses warehouse perimeter waypoints for much of the route, reducing congestion from central activity.
  - All waypoints along this route (A22, B22, etc. and G21–G4) are valid and match the Area Valid Waypoints lists.
  - Efficiently loops Worker B back to Area 1 for sustained cyclic activity.

---

**Summary:**
- All paths rigorously follow the Area Valid Waypoints, avoid all listed Invalid Waypoints, and explicitly leverage edge points (especially for shelf and storage operations near the boundaries).
- Route explanations highlight the efficiency of edge use and demonstrate safe, direct movements while minimizing conflicts within the operational core of the warehouse.  
- These movement plans indirectly shape environmental conditions for the robot, creating natural moments of crossing/interference strictly by the way space is used—without any direct interaction.

You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16

- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.

---

### **Task 3: Area 3 → Shelf 6**
#### Original Path: [G12, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12, A12, A14, A16, A18, A20, A22]

**Validation:**
- **Start (G12):** Valid (Area 3).
- **F12, E12:** Not assigned to any area (just corridors)—acceptable *as corridor transitions only*.
- **D12, C12, B12, A12:** Listed as valid access points for Shelf 1 and Shelf 2.
- **A14, A16, A18, A20, A22:** Of these, only A20, A22 (and B20, B22, etc.) are in Shelf 6’s valid waypoints.
- **A14, A16, A18:** **Invalid for Shelf 6**; these are only permitted for Shelf 2–5.

**Problem:**
- **A14, A16, A18** are on Row A and are specifically listed as *invalid* for Shelf 6 (and some are specifically marked as *invalid* (A13, A15, A17, A19, A21) in the blocked-waypoint list). However, when moving physically toward A22 via A12, the route passes through non-Shelf 6 area valid waypoints.

**Invalid Waypoints?:**
- **A14, A16, A18** are not among Shelf 6’s allowed edge points (A20, A22 only).

**Discontinuities?:**
- Transition is possible, but functional-area validity is not preserved for direct access to Shelf 6.

**Correction:**
**Proposed Valid Route:**
- From **G12** (Area 3), go vertically up the 12th column using corridors to Shelf 2 access at D12 (valid for Shelf 2), but then, to reach Shelf 6’s A20 or A22 entry, traverse corridor points only.

- **New Route:**  
  [G12, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12, A12, A20, A22]

**But:** Direct travel from A12 to A20 or A22 may cross invalid A-row waypoints (A13, A15, A17, A19, A21 are explicitly blocked); only jump from A12 to A20 if a physical route exists, **otherwise must use B-row or C-row as corridors to reach B20/B22/C20/C22 before going up to A20/A22**.

**Alternative valid revised route** (minimize A-row movements, maximize permitted edge points):

- [G12, F12, E12, D12, C12, C20, B20, A20, A22]

**Waypoints check:**
- **C12, C20:** Valid—C12 for shelf access/corridor, C20 is a valid shelf 6 access point.
- **B20, A20, A22:** Valid access points for Shelf 6.
- **No invalid waypoints traversed.**

**Summary:**  
- **Original segment invalid (due to A14, A16, A18 usage).**
- **Revised segment**: [G12, F12, E12, D12, C12, C20, B20, A20, A22]

---

### **Task 4: Shelf 6 → Area 1**
#### Original Path:  
[A22, B22, C22, D22, E22, F21, G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4]

**Validation:**
- **Start (A22):** Valid (Shelf 6 Edge).
- **B22, C22, D22:** Valid (Shelf 6).
- **E22, F21:** **E22 is not listed as a valid waypoint for any area**—nor is F21. Both are not in any area’s valid waypoints, and **F21** is not specifically blocked but is not listed for any valid area here.
- **G21 through G4:** G21 is valid (Area 5), so are G20, G19, G18 (Area 5), G17/G16/G15 (Area 4), G14–G12 (Area 3), G11–G7 (Area 3/2), G6–G4 (Area 1).

**Area Valid Waypoints:**
- **Only use area entry/exit points for traversing functional areas.** Traversing G21–G15 crosses multiple functional area boundaries but sticks to allowed per-area waypoints.

**Problem:**
- **E22 is not in any valid area waypoint set**.
- **F21 is not in any valid area waypoint set.**
- **Transition from D22 down to G21 passing through E22 and F21 is not area-sanctioned.**

**Correction:**
- Return from A22 (Shelf 6) to Area 1 (G4) entirely via corridor waypoints and *area-specific boundary crossings only*.
- **Shortest possible valid revised path**:
  - **A22, B22, C22, D22** (all valid for Shelf 6)
  - **D20, C20, B20, A20** *(these are valid for Shelf 6; D20, C20, etc.)*
  - Move down via column 20 to G20 (Area 5), then horizontally left on the G-row to G4.

**Adjusted valid segment:**
- [A22, B22, C22, D22, D20, C20, B20, A20, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4]

- **All points:**
  - Start/end points per area valid waypoint lists.
  - Route descends only via permitted shelf access and uses only Area 5 (G20, G19, G18) and Area 4 (G17–G15) waypoints, then Area 3 (G14–G11), Area 2 (G10–G7), and Area 1 (G6–G4).

**Summary:**
- **Original segment included unauthorized non-area waypoints (E22, F21).**
- **Revised segment corrects this with only valid waypoints along columns corresponding to shelf access and across the G-row for all necessary area transitions.**

---

#### **Loop closure for Worker B:**
- Last point (G4) matches starting point of first segment. **Loop closed.**

---

### **Summary of Corrections and Validation Errors**

#### **Worker A:**  
- **All segments valid, no corrections needed.**

#### **Worker B:**  
1. **Area 3 → Shelf 6**:  
   - **Invalid path**: Used A14, A16, A18 (not permitted for Shelf 6).
   - **Correction**: [G12, F12, E12, D12, C12, C20, B20, A20, A22]

2. **Shelf 6 → Area 1**:  
   - **Invalid path**: Used E22, F21 (not on any area’s valid waypoint list).
   - **Correction**: [A22, B22, C22, D22, D20, C20, B20, A20, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4]

**All other Worker B segments: Valid as given.**

---

#### **General Conclusion:**
- **Worker A:** All segments compliant and valid.
- **Worker B:** Two segments required rerouting to avoid invalid waypoints and respect all area waypoint restrictions. After correction, all routes are valid, continuous, and form a proper closed functional loop.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
