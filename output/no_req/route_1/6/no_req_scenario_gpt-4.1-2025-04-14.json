  "scenario": "During a peak workflow period, Worker A performs receiving and sorting of inbound goods in Areas 1 and 2 before transporting packaging waste to the Waste Area and moving sorted inventory to Area 3 for staging. Simultaneously, Worker B retrieves staged goods from Area 3 to restock onto Shelf 6, while also fulfilling outbound orders from shelves to dispatch zones using the pallet jack. Both workers' tasks frequently overlap in Area 3 and along the central corridor, causing dynamic, workflow-driven obstructions and congestion. An autonomous robot collects items from Area 3 and navigates to Shelf 6, detecting and responding to unpredictable environmental obstacles arising solely from the workers’ ongoing activities, without any direct communication. The scenario reflects a realistic, high-activity warehouse operation with naturally overlapping responsibilities and shared resource use.",
