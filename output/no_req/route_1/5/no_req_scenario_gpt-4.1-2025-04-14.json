  "scenario": "Two human workers handle concurrent receiving, inspection, and storage tasks in the warehouse. Worker A inspects and sorts inbound inventory in Areas 1 and 2, then stages items in Area 3. Worker B supplies packing materials from Large Shelf 1 to the operational zones, assists with joint inspections in Area 2, and alternates between staging and preparing items for dispatch or additional storage. Both workers repeatedly cross the main corridor and may temporarily leave boxes or carts on or near waypoints along F12–F18 and at E21 while performing their tasks. At the same time, an autonomous robot collects items from Area 3 at G12 and navigates the route G12 → F12 → F13 → F14 → F15 → F16 → F17 → F18 → E18 → E19 → E20 → E21, delivering goods to Shelf 6. The robot must autonomously react to dynamic changes in its environment—pausing or rerouting when its path is blocked by boxes, carts, or workers during their workflow—without any direct communication, reflecting a realistic, congested, and collaborative warehouse scenario.",
