  "scenario": "Worker 1 is responsible for restocking shelves, primarily moving items from the bulk storage area (Region 1) to sorting/staging areas (Areas 1–3 in Region 3), and then to shelves (especially Shelf 6 in Region 2) as needed. Worker 2 handles inspection and dispatch preparation, retrieving items from large shelves (Region 4), sorting and staging them for outgoing shipments in Areas 4–5, and operating the pallet jack for dispatch near Area 5. Both workers frequently pass through shared operational zones in Region 3, particularly Area 3, and the central corridors, leading to routine proximity and potential congestion. The autonomous robot, starting at Area 3 (G12), detects and picks up restock items staged by Worker 1 and transports them to Shelf 6 (E21) in Region 2, adapting its navigation in real time to changing obstructions caused by both workers’ legitimate activities and any moved stock, without direct communication or instruction.",
