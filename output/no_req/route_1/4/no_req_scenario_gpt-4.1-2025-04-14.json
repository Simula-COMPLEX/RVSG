  "scenario": "Worker 1 receives and inspects incoming pallets in Region 3 Areas 1 and 2, sorting and discarding waste, while Worker 2 retrieves sorted items and carries them along Row F to Region 2 shelves or Region 4 large shelves for storage and replenishment. Both workers frequently transit overlapping central corridors, with Worker 2 often storing items on Shelf 6 near E21 just as the autonomous robot is transporting a batch from Area 3 (G12) to Shelf 6 via waypoints F12–E21. The robot halts, recalculates, or waits as needed when worker actions or temporary obstacles (workers or boxes) appear along its path, with all reactions triggered solely by real-time environmental changes, ensuring authentic operational interplay but no direct human-robot communication.",
