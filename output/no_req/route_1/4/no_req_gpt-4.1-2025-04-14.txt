You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point G12 in Area 3, and travels rightward from row G to row E, moving from column 12 to column 21, and ends around E21 near Shelf 6. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: G12 → F12 → F13 → F14 → F15 → F16 → F17 → F18 → E18 → E19 → E20 → E21. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material transport task, picking up an item from Area 3 and delivering it to Shelf 6 for storage or replenishment.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.

### Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis

#### Warehouse Operational Use Case: Receiving, Sorting, Storage, and Replenishment

**Workflow Overview**

This scenario covers a typical warehouse day where both inbound stock is being received, sorted, inspected, and stored, while at the same time, frequently used items are being replenished onto central shelves. The focus is on overlapping roles with two human workers whose activities overlap in space and function, alongside the autonomous robot performing directed storage/replenishment tasks.

#### Worker Roles and Responsibilities

- **Worker 1: Receiving & Inspection Specialist**
  - **Primary Duties**: Accepts new deliveries in Region 3 (Areas 1 & 2), inspects items, sorts them by type/priority, and initiates movement of items to designated storage.
  - **Pathways/Areas Used**: Mainly in Area 1 and Area 2 (F–J, C5–C12), sometimes moves to Waste Area (F–J, C1–C4) for discarding damaged packaging/material.
  - **Movements**: Brings received items from pallet drop (entrance, near Area 5) to Areas 1 or 2, inspects them, then prepares for further internal transfer.

- **Worker 2: Storage & Replenishment Specialist**
  - **Primary Duties**: Picks up sorted/inspected items (from Area 2 or adjacent zones), carries them through the central aisle (Row F) toward storage locations (e.g., Shelf 1–6 in Region 2) or large shelves (Region 4), and replenishes stock to maintain availability for picking.
  - **Pathways/Areas Used**: Circulates between Areas 2–5 in Region 3, Region 2 Shelves (E10–E22), and may occasionally go to Large Shelves (L–M, C10–C21) for bulkier items.
  - **Movements**: Frequently traverses Row F, moving rightward past the front of Shelves 1–6, and also uses vertical waypoints to switch between shelf rows and operational areas.

#### Scenario Sequence

1. **Receiving Phase (Start of Shift):**
   - Worker 1 is stationed near Area 5 to receive incoming pallets with the pallet jack, moving them into Area 1 (G8) or Area 2 (G10–G12).
   - Worker 1 inspects, scans, and sorts items. Defective packaging/materials are sent to the Waste Area (G2), requiring short detours.

2. **Sorting & Hand-off:**
   - Once the items are inspected, Worker 1 moves sorted batches into Area 2 (shared staging with Worker 2).
   - Worker 1 continues to process more incoming items, occasionally crossing the same spaces repeatedly as new deliveries arrive in waves.

3. **Replenishment & Storage:**
   - Worker 2 retrieves items from Area 2, then proceeds along Row F, passing directly in front of Shelves 1–6 in Region 2 (E13–E21) to store items.
   - Depending on stock type, Worker 2 may also descend vertically (Columns 13–21) to Large Shelves in Region 4, adding further cross-traffic in central corridors.

4. **Shared Pathways and Overlaps:**
   - Both workers frequently use Row F and the vertical waypoints at Columns 9 and 13–19, especially as new items arrive and are moved en masse for timely replenishment.
   - The primary spatial congestion occurs where Worker 2 is storing on Shelf 6 (E21) simultaneously as Worker 1 brings loads toward Area 2, or vice versa, as both may cluster around the column 18–21 corridor at peak times.

5. **Robot Operation:**
   - The robot starts at G12 in Area 3, is assigned to transport a batch from Area 3 (perhaps just sorted by Worker 1) to Shelf 6 at E21.
   - As per the defined robot route, it proceeds from G12 → F12 → ... → E21 along the center-right of the warehouse.
   - If either worker places a cart, box, or themselves temporarily in front of F18–E21 (as is likely during active storage/replenishment), the robot halts, recalculates, or waits, strictly based on real-time obstacle detection.
   - No explicit communication or direct interaction occurs; any robot delay or rerouting is purely reactive to environmental congestion or blockages from ongoing human workflow.

#### Realism and Process Fit

- The described scenario mirrors a real, high-activity warehouse during simultaneous inbound processing and stock replenishment, with overlapping worker zones and peak congestion along shared corridors.
- Roles are distinct but frequently intersect out of genuine operational need (receiving, sorting, replenishing), making close spatial overlap and temporary resource contention inevitable.
- The robot is integrated as an autonomous storage/replenishment asset—its path strongly overlaps with the main worker transit routes without explicit human-robot coordination, accurately reflecting current warehouse practices under partial automation.
- Workers (especially Worker 2) often encounter and indirectly affect the robot by simply performing their own tasks, a realistic situation in environments where material flow cannot be fully decoupled.

### Scenario Summary in JSON

```json
{
  "scenario": "Worker 1 receives and inspects incoming pallets in Region 3 Areas 1 and 2, sorting and discarding waste, while Worker 2 retrieves sorted items and carries them along Row F to Region 2 shelves or Region 4 large shelves for storage and replenishment. Both workers frequently transit overlapping central corridors, with Worker 2 often storing items on Shelf 6 near E21 just as the autonomous robot is transporting a batch from Area 3 (G12) to Shelf 6 via waypoints F12–E21. The robot halts, recalculates, or waits as needed when worker actions or temporary obstacles (workers or boxes) appear along its path, with all reactions triggered solely by real-time environmental changes, ensuring authentic operational interplay but no direct human-robot communication."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


### High-Level Cyclic Task Sequences

#### Worker 1: Receiving & Inspection Specialist

**Sequence (Functional Areas Only):**  
**Area 5 → Boxes 1 → Area 1 → Waste Area → Area 2 → Area 5**

---

**Reasoning:**

1. **Area 5 (Start):** The worker begins at Area 5, the typical entry/receiving point for new pallets. This aligns with real warehouse practice: workers start their cycle where new goods arrive or need to be received.

2. **Boxes 1:** From Area 5, the worker moves to Boxes 1 to collect or retrieve the next batch of goods designated for inspection or immediate processing; this reflects bulk storage access for initial item collection or additional inbound stock not unloaded directly to the operational zones.

3. **Area 1:** Goods are brought into Area 1, which is dedicated to initial sorting and inspection. This step supports the operational need for immediate quality checks and organized material breakdown upon receipt.

4. **Waste Area:** Any rejected, damaged, or excess packaging is then transported to the Waste Area, supporting the need to keep primary sorting areas clear and operationally efficient.

5. **Area 2:** The worker then delivers the inspected and approved items to Area 2, the secondary staging zone, which transitions items for next steps such as storage or further internal transfer. Completing this handoff maintains process flow and collaboration with Worker 2.

6. **Area 5 (Return):** The worker returns to Area 5 to begin another receiving and inspection cycle, forming a self-contained loop harmonized with the ongoing inbound logistics rhythm.

**Operational Support:**  
This cycle ensures a continuous intake, inspection, and handoff rhythm, reduces clutter in operational areas, and keeps approved inventory steadily flowing toward storage. It leverages the warehouse layout’s logical flow, from receiving (Area 5) to inspection (Area 1), through waste management, and ends with prepping stock for the next process stage.

---

#### Worker 2: Storage & Replenishment Specialist

**Sequence (Functional Areas Only):**  
**Area 2 → Shelf 6 → Large Shelf 2 → Large Shelf 4 → Area 3 → Area 2**

---

**Reasoning:**

1. **Area 2 (Start):** Worker 2 starts by collecting batches or items staged and ready for storage from Area 2, matching the handoff from Worker 1 and keeping workflow tightly integrated.

2. **Shelf 6:** The worker proceeds to Shelf 6, one of the main targeted shelving areas for replenishing everyday stock, reflecting the need to keep high-turnover shelves supplied.

3. **Large Shelf 2:** After replenishing the regular shelf, Worker 2 proceeds to Large Shelf 2 for bulkier or overflow stock that must also be kept in rotation, maximizing spatial efficiency and product organization.

4. **Large Shelf 4:** Next, the worker visits Large Shelf 4, ensuring lower-frequency but crucial inventory is maintained and that physical movement encompasses the entire lower storage region.

5. **Area 3:** The worker then moves to Area 3, which may receive temporary returns, adjust misplaced goods, or pre-stage sorted items for dispatch or further organization, emphasizing the need for continuous cycle checks and flexible support for warehouse fluidity.

6. **Area 2 (Return):** The worker returns to Area 2 to restart the cycle, ready to collect new staged items for the next storage loop.

**Operational Support:**  
This sequence tightly connects the “input” from sorting/staging (Area 2) to the replenishment of both fast-move and bulk storage (Shelves and Large Shelves), incorporates quality control via Area 3 check-ins, and then cycles back to support process continuity. It mirrors practical warehouse replenishment logic—pull from staging, store across the main and bulk zones, support ongoing workflow, and loop for consistency.

## **Summary Table**

| Worker  | Cyclic Sequence (Functional Areas Only)                                 |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Worker 1| Area 5 → Boxes 1 → Area 1 → Waste Area → Area 2 → Area 5               |
| Worker 2| Area 2 → Shelf 6 → Large Shelf 2 → Large Shelf 4 → Area 3 → Area 2     |


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


---

## Worker 1: Receiving & Inspection Specialist

**Cyclic Task Sequence:** Area 5 → Boxes 1 → Area 1 → Waste Area → Area 2 → Area 5

---

### Step 1: Area 5 → Boxes 1

- **Start:** G18 (Area 5)
- **End:** E1 (Boxes 1)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  `[G18, F18, E18, E9, E3, E2, E1]`

**Explanation:** 
- Starts at G18 (Area 5 valid start).
- Moves left along Row G/F to E18, then up toward the front of the warehouse.
- Uses E9 as a central "junction," then transitions left to E3–E2–E1, which are valid edge entry points for Boxes 1.
- E1 is on the warehouse’s left edge, maximizing direct access; route avoids all invalid waypoints.

---

### Step 2: Boxes 1 → Area 1

- **Start:** E1 (Boxes 1)
- **End:** G4 (Area 1)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  `[E1, F1, G1, G4]`

**Explanation:** 
- Exits E1 straight down to F1 and G1, which is valid (G1 is not an invalid waypoint).
- Moves right along Row G to G4, a valid entry point for Area 1.
- Very direct use of edge waypoints (E1, F1, G1); avoids all obstacles.

---

### Step 3: Area 1 → Waste Area

- **Start:** G4 (Area 1)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  `[G4, G3]`

**Explanation:** 
- Simply moves one step left from G4 (Area 1) directly to adjacent G3 (Waste Area).
- Both are valid waypoints for their respective areas. No obstacles.

---

### Step 4: Waste Area → Area 2

- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **End:** G8 (Area 2)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  `[G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8]`

**Explanation:** 
- Moves right along Row G through G4 to G8, progressively passing Area 1 and arriving at Area 2.
- All waypoints are valid; movement is along an unobstructed corridor, and G8 is a listed Area 2 access point.

---

### Step 5: Area 2 → Area 5

- **Start:** G8 (Area 2)
- **End:** G18 (Area 5)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  `[G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18]`

**Explanation:** 
- Efficient straight-line movement across Row G from Area 2 to Area 5.
- G8 and G18 are valid waypoints for their areas.
- Route hugs the central corridor, no invalid points, enabling a clear, repeatable loop.

---

## Worker 2: Storage & Replenishment Specialist

**Cyclic Task Sequence:** Area 2 → Shelf 6 → Large Shelf 2 → Large Shelf 4 → Area 3 → Area 2

---

### Step 1: Area 2 → Shelf 6

- **Start:** G8 (Area 2)
- **End:** A22 (Shelf 6)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  `[G8, F8, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9, A12, A14, A16, A18, A20, A22]`

**Explanation:** 
- Up from G8 through F8 and E8 toward the front shelving lines, reaching D9 (Boxes 3, shelf approach), then progressively moves left to A9 (front of Shelf 1).
- Follows the top row (Row A) along edge waypoints through valid shelf points A12, A14, A16, A18, A20 to A22 (all valid Shelf 6 access points).
- Uses edge waypoints (Row A) as a high-speed, unobstructed route to efficiently cross front shelves and avoid lower area congestion.

---

### Step 2: Shelf 6 → Large Shelf 2

- **Start:** A22 (Shelf 6)
- **End:** M12 (Large Shelf 2)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  `[A22, B22, C22, D22, E22, F22, G21, H21, I22, J22, K22, L22, M22, M21, M20, M19, M18, M17, M16, M15, M14, M13, M12]`

**Explanation:** 
- Moves straight down the rightmost edge (Column 22), using every valid edge point down to M22.
- Moves left along bottom Row M, entering Large Shelf 4’s and Large Shelf 2’s zones via sequential edge points.
- Finally enters M12 of Large Shelf 2 after passing through the shared lower boundary, leveraging M-edge waypoints for efficient, congestion-free travel and full compliance with area constraints.

---

### Step 3: Large Shelf 2 → Large Shelf 4

- **Start:** M12 (Large Shelf 2)
- **End:** M18 (Large Shelf 4)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  `[M12, M13, M14, M15, M16, M17, M18]`

**Explanation:** 
- Moves right along Row M directly, seamlessly transitioning between shelf areas using adjacent, valid edge waypoints.
- All waypoints are within valid lists for these large shelf zones.
- Highly efficient as it follows a single row without vertical deviation.

---

### Step 4: Large Shelf 4 → Area 3

- **Start:** M18 (Large Shelf 4)
- **End:** G12 (Area 3)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  `[M18, L18, K18, J18, I18 (skip–invalid), I17, H17, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12]`

**Explanation:** 
- Moves up from M18 through L18, K18, and as I18 is invalid, uses I17 instead, then right along H17, then down to G17 and left toward Area 3.
- Follows valid waypoint corridors, carefully skipping the listed invalid points, and selects the nearest available entry (G12) for Area 3.

---

### Step 5: Area 3 → Area 2

- **Start:** G12 (Area 3)
- **End:** G8 (Area 2)
- **Waypoint Path:**  
  `[G12, G11, G10, G9, G8]`

**Explanation:** 
- Moves left along Row G, connecting directly from G12 (Area 3) to G8 (Area 2) using valid waypoints for both areas.
- This direct path is unobstructed, short, and enables a seamless return to loop the cycle.

---

**Edge and efficiency considerations:**  
- Edge waypoints (e.g., A22, B22, M12, M18, M22) are explicitly chosen to bypass congested mid-warehouse corridors, especially for long moves between shelf zones at periphery.
- All routes avoid invalid waypoints by detouring via adjacent valid points, even if this requires a small detour (e.g., skipping I18 in Worker 2’s Step 4).
- Paths are chosen to maximize operational realism and efficiency, minimize likely robot congestion/interference, and ensure all area access is by valid, natural shelf/zone entry points as described in the layout and scenario.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9

- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.

## Worker 1: Receiving & Inspection Specialist

### Step 1: Area 5 → Boxes 1  
**Path:** `[G18, F18, E18, E9, E3, E2, E1]`

**Validation:**
- **Area 5 valid waypoints:** G18 is valid.
- **Boxes 1 valid waypoints:** E1, E2, E3 are valid.
- **All waypoints:** F18, E18, E9, E3, E2 are not in the list of invalid points.
- **Continuity:** All steps are continuous, no jumps.
- **End in-area compliance:** E1 (Boxes 1) is a valid end.

**Result:**  
**No validation errors. Path is valid.**

---

### Step 2: Boxes 1 → Area 1  
**Path:** `[E1, F1, G1, G4]`

**Validation:**
- **Boxes 1 valid waypoints:** E1 is valid.
- **Area 1 valid waypoints:** G4 is valid.
- **All waypoints:** F1, G1
  - **F1:** Invalid (listed under invalids, Row F)
  - **G1:** Invalid (listed under invalids, Row G)

**Issues:**
- F1 (invalid waypoint) is used.
- G1 (invalid waypoint) is used.

**Correction proposal:**  
Find a route from E1 (Boxes 1) to G4 (Area 1) using only valid waypoints:

**Options:**  
- From E1 (Boxes 1), Area 1 is at G4.  
- Adjacency via E3/E2 into Row F/G is possible.  
- F1 and G1 are not allowed.  
- From E1, move right along Row E to E3 (still Boxes 1 valid), then down to G4.

**Corrected path:** `[E1, E2, E3, F3, G3, G4]`
- E1, E2, E3 (Boxes 1, valid)
- F3, G3 (Waste Area, both valid for transition; not on the invalid list)
- G4 (Area 1, valid)

---

### Step 3: Area 1 → Waste Area  
**Path:** `[G4, G3]`

**Validation:**
- **Area 1 valid waypoints:** G4 is valid.
- **Waste Area valid waypoints:** G3 is valid.
- Both G4 and G3 are valid.
- Continuity: Direct step; no additional waypoints between.

**Result:**  
**No validation errors. Path is valid.**

---

### Step 4: Waste Area → Area 2  
**Path:** `[G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8]`

**Validation:**
- **Waste Area valid waypoints:** G3 is valid start.
- **Area 2 valid waypoints:** G8 is valid end.
- **Area 1 valid waypoints:** G4–G7
- **All waypoints:** None in the invalid list.
- When transiting, G3 (Waste Area), G4–G7 (Area 1), G8 (Area 2) – all are on the corresponding valid lists.

**Result:**  
**No validation errors. Path is valid.**

---

### Step 5: Area 2 → Area 5  
**Path:** `[G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18]`

**Validation:**
- **Area 2 valid waypoints:** G8 is valid start.
- **Area 5 valid waypoints:** G18 is valid end.
- **Intermediate waypoints:** G9, G10 (Area 2 valid), others (transit spaces).
- **All waypoints:** G8–G21, except G22, are valid on Row G.
- None of these are in the invalid list.

**Result:**  
**No validation errors. Path is valid.**

---

## Worker 1: Final Check

- All start/end points valid.
- Each step's end is the next step's start (G18-E1, E1-G4, etc.).
- Final end point G18 is same as initial, forming a closed loop.
- Area transitions use only area-valid waypoints.
- **All segments valid except Step 2, which is corrected as above.**

---

## Worker 2: Storage & Replenishment Specialist

### Step 1: Area 2 → Shelf 6  
**Path:** `[G8, F8, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9, A12, A14, A16, A18, A20, A22]`

**Validation:**
- **Area 2 valid waypoints:** G8 is valid.
- **Shelf 6 valid waypoints:** A22 is valid.
- **Intermediate waypoints:**  
  - F8, E8: Not in the invalid list.
  - D9 (Boxes 3 area-valid, valid), C9/B9/A9 (Boxes 3/Shelf 1 area-valid, valid).
  - A12 (Shelf 1/Shelf 2), A14 (Shelf 2/3), A16 (Shelf 3/4), A18 (Shelf 4/5), A20 (Shelf 5/6), all area-valid.
- **Area-valid within areas:** When inside shelf/box areas, all entry points are valid.
- **Invalids check:** F8, E8, and all listed are not on the blocked list.

**Result:**  
**No validation errors. Path is valid.**

---

### Step 2: Shelf 6 → Large Shelf 2  
**Path:** `[A22, B22, C22, D22, E22, F22, G21, H21, I22, J22, K22, L22, M22, M21, M20, M19, M18, M17, M16, M15, M14, M13, M12]`

**Validation:**
- **Shelf 6 valid waypoints:** A22 is valid start.
- **Large Shelf 2 valid waypoints:** M12 is valid end.
- **Intermediate waypoints:**  
  - B22, C22, D22 (Shelf 6 valid).
  - E22, F22 (Pallet Jack valid, F22 is not blocked and used as Pallet Jack).
  - G21, H21 (Pallet Jack valid, not listed as blocked).
  - I22, J22, K22, L22, M22 (Row 22, none are in invalid list).
  - M21-M12 (Large Shelves 4–2 valid waypoints).
- **Invalids check:** None of these points are on the invalid list.

**Result:**  
**No validation errors. Path is valid.**

---

### Step 3: Large Shelf 2 → Large Shelf 4  
**Path:** `[M12, M13, M14, M15, M16, M17, M18]`

**Validation:**
- **Large Shelf 2 valid waypoints:** M12 is valid start.
- **Large Shelf 4 valid waypoints:** M18 is valid end.
- **Intermediate waypoints:** M13–M17 lie within Large Shelf 3, all area-valid.
- **Invalids check:** No points in invalid list.

**Result:**  
**No validation errors. Path is valid.**

---

### Step 4: Large Shelf 4 → Area 3  
**Path:** `[M18, L18, K18, J18, I18 (skip–invalid), I17, H17, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12]`

**Validation:**
- **Large Shelf 4 valid waypoints:** M18 is valid.
- **Area 3 valid waypoints:** G12 is valid.

**Correction proposal:**  
- **Detour via valid points:**  
  - From M18: L18 (valid), K18 (valid).
  - Instead of J18, use J17 (valid for Area 4), then I17 (valid), H17, G17 etc.

**Corrected path:**  
`[M18, L18, K18, J17, I17, H17, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12]`

---

### Step 5: Area 3 → Area 2  
**Path:** `[G12, G11, G10, G9, G8]`

**Validation:**
- **Area 3 valid waypoints:** G12 is valid start.
- **Area 2 valid waypoints:** G8 is valid end.
- **Intermediate waypoints:** G11 (Area 3 valid), G10-G8 (Area 2 valid).
- **All waypoints:** None are in the invalid list.

**Result:**  
**No validation errors. Path is valid.**

---

## Worker 2: Final Check

- All start/end points are valid.
- All transitions' ends match next step's start.
- Full cycle returns to original Area 2 start.
- Only one error: invalid use of J18, I18 (corrected using J17, I17).
- All other pathways are valid, use area-valid entries/exits.

| Worker 2 | Large Shelf 4 → Area 3         | J18, I18                 | `[M18, L18, K18, J17, I17, H17, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12]`         |

**All other routes are confirmed valid as constructed.**


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
