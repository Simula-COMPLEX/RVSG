  "scenario": "During a high-throughput receiving and replenishment shift, Worker 1 manages the unloading and sorting of inbound goods using the pallet jack, moving between Area 5, the inspection/sorting zones (Areas 1-3), and the Waste Area, while Worker 2 alternately retrieves sorted products from Areas 2 and 3 to restock Shelf 6 in Region 2. Both workers regularly cross paths—particularly along the main corridor and near the target storage shelf—causing dynamic congestion and intermittent physical obstructions in the robot’s pre-programmed route from Area 3 (G12) to Shelf 6 (E21). The robot, which operates without human instruction, autonomously detects and reacts to these environmental changes, such as worker presence, obstacles, or relocated items, occasionally pausing or rerouting to complete its delivery task. This scenario simulates realistic process-driven congestion, indirect interference, and spatial competition common in modern warehouse operations.",
