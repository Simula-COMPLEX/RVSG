========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point G12 in Area 3, and travels rightward from row G to row E, moving from column 12 to column 21, and ends around E21 near Shelf 6. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: G12 → F12 → F13 → F14 → F15 → F16 → F17 → F18 → E18 → E19 → E20 → E21. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material transport task, picking up an item from Area 3 and delivering it to Shelf 6 for storage or replenishment.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis:**

### Use Case: High-Throughput Receiving, Sorting, and Shelf Replenishment with Worker-Robot Overlap

#### **Workflow Overview**
The warehouse is in peak operational mode to handle an influx of inbound goods, requiring rapid receiving, inspection, and storage replenishment. This period involves both human workers and an autonomous mobile robot (AMR), all utilizing the shared regions and main corridors around Region 3 and the shelves in Region 2. The process includes receiving goods, sorting/inspection, replenishing shelf stock, and waste handling, with several hand-offs and overlapping activity zones.

---

#### **Worker 1: Receiving and Sorting Coordinator**
**Role & Responsibility:**  
- Responsible for unloading new shipments from inbound pallets placed initially near Area 5 (close to the pallet jack, G21-H21).
- Transports received goods using the pallet jack through the main pathway (Row H/K, Columns 21 → Columns 12/13).
- Delivers newly received items to operational Areas 1, 2, or 3 in Region 3 (Area 1: G6-H8, Area 2: G9-H11, Area 3: G12-H14).
- Performs basic inspection, unpacking, rough sorting, and adds material to the relevant sorting areas.
- As sorting progresses, occasionally needs to walk between Areas 1, 2, 3, and the Waste Area (F1-G5) to dispose of packing material or rejected goods.

**Zone Movement:**  
- Frequently moves between Area 5 and Areas 1-3, using the central corridor and sometimes sharing space with the robot.
- Occupies waypoints F12-F14, E12-E14, and sometimes passes through G/H21 and Waste Area G2.

---

#### **Worker 2: Replenishment and Storage Specialist**
**Role & Responsibility:**  
- Monitors shelf inventory in Region 2 (Shelves 1–6, E10-E21), receiving sorted pallets/items from operational areas.
- Retrieves replenished product batches from Areas 2 and 3, walking through the corridor (F13-F21, E13-E21).
- Places items in the correct shelf location, using the main access corridors. Occasionally needs to return to operational zones if corrections or additional items are needed.
- Occasionally assists in bulk organization, resulting in temporary blockages in front of the shelf or when regrouping boxes from large shelves in Region 4 as backstock (moves: K13-K21, E14-E20).

**Zone Movement:**  
- Regularly moves between Areas 2/3 (F13/F14) and Shelf 6 (E21), following route F13-F14→F15-F21→E18-E21.
- May be stationed near a shelf, taking up space at E21/F21 or creating a transient obstacle as boxes are moved in/out.

---

#### **Robot: Autonomous Material Transport**
**Role & Responsibility:**  
- Tasked with transporting a pre-sorted item from Area 3 (starting at G12) to Shelf 6 (ending at E21).
- Follows the pre-programmed route: G12 → F12 → F13 → F14 → F15 → F16 → F17 → F18 → E18 → E19 → E20 → E21, matching the grid waypoint network.
- The robot does not communicate with people, only responding to detected physical obstructions or moved objects along its route (e.g., waiting if a worker momentarily blocks a corridor or shelf access, rerouting if an unplanned box is set in a pathway, etc.).

---

### **Operational Overlap, Congestion, and Realism**

This scenario is operationally realistic because:
- **Division of Labor:** Responsibilities reflect real warehouse roles—one worker manages intake and sorting, the other replenishes shelves—yet their workflows overlap due to the interconnected layout.
- **Mutual Interference:** Both workers naturally traverse the main corridor and operational zones, leading to congestion near waypoints F12–F21/E12–E21 (the same pathway and shelf access points used by the AMR). This spatial overlap is not forced, but arises from authentic process requirements.
- **Dynamic Environment:** The presence of both workers in sorting areas (1–3) and shelf regions can trigger the robot’s obstacle-detection routines: the AMR may pause, reroute, or wait, all due to the workers’ regular tasks (such as pausing to inspect, dropping packing waste, or reorganizing items) or temporary material placement.
- **Resource Sharing:** The pallet jack and shared aisleways see concurrent use; workers may need to coordinate stacking or waste disposal, but the robot reacts only to their physical presence or moved objects—not to direct interaction.
- **High-Throughput Flow:** Multiple trips, returns for correction, and simultaneous handling of inspection and replenishment represent typical warehousing bottlenecks and surges, particularly under high activity or restocking scenarios.

---

### **Summary JSON Output**

```json
{
  "scenario": "During a high-throughput receiving and replenishment shift, Worker 1 manages the unloading and sorting of inbound goods using the pallet jack, moving between Area 5, the inspection/sorting zones (Areas 1-3), and the Waste Area, while Worker 2 alternately retrieves sorted products from Areas 2 and 3 to restock Shelf 6 in Region 2. Both workers regularly cross paths—particularly along the main corridor and near the target storage shelf—causing dynamic congestion and intermittent physical obstructions in the robot’s pre-programmed route from Area 3 (G12) to Shelf 6 (E21). The robot, which operates without human instruction, autonomously detects and reacts to these environmental changes, such as worker presence, obstacles, or relocated items, occasionally pausing or rerouting to complete its delivery task. This scenario simulates realistic process-driven congestion, indirect interference, and spatial competition common in modern warehouse operations."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**Worker 1: Receiving and Sorting Coordinator**

**High-Level Cyclic Task Sequence:**
1. **Area 5 → Area 1**: Collect inbound goods from Area 5 (receiving/staging zone) and transport them to Area 1 for preliminary sorting/inspection.
2. **Area 1 → Area 2**: Move partially sorted goods from Area 1 to Area 2 for further sorting or specific inspection steps.
3. **Area 2 → Area 3**: Transfer fully sorted or inspected goods ready for shelf replenishment from Area 2 to Area 3 (final staging for robot or worker pick-up).
4. **Area 3 → Waste Area**: Gather and carry any sorting debris, rejected goods, or packing waste generated in Area 3 to the Waste Area for disposal.
5. **Waste Area → Area 5**: Return to Area 5 to begin the next receiving cycle, closing the loop.

**Reasoning:**  
This order follows the logical flow of material intake and processing:
- **Area 5** is where inbound goods arrive and where the task starts.
- **Area 1** handles initial sorting, needed immediately after receipt.
- **Areas 2 and 3** represent progressively refined or staged materials, aligning with inspection and readiness for downstream use or storage.
- **Waste Area** deals with byproducts (waste/rejects) central to realistic process maintenance.
- The cycle returns to **Area 5** for sustained, uninterrupted throughput, supporting high-activity, repeatable shift operations.



---

**Worker 2: Replenishment and Storage Specialist**

**High-Level Cyclic Task Sequence:**
1. **Shelf 6 → Area 2**: Begin at Shelf 6 (target for replenishment checks), walk to Area 2 to collect items pre-sorted for restocking.
2. **Area 2 → Area 3**: If additional or alternate items required for Shelf 6 are found in Area 3, collect those as well.
3. **Area 3 → Shelf 6**: Transfer all collected items from Areas 2 and/or 3 to Shelf 6 and perform replenishment.
4. **Shelf 6 → Large Shelf 2**: After restocking, check Large Shelf 2 (in Region 4) for overstock or reserve goods that might need staging in sorting areas for the next cycle.
5. **Large Shelf 2 → Shelf 6**: Return with any required reserves from Large Shelf 2 to Shelf 6, ensuring readiness, and to close the operational loop by ending where the next cycle will begin.

**Reasoning:**  
- The cycle **originates at Shelf 6** (the principal shelf requiring maintenance), confirming alignment with the replenishment role.
- **Areas 2 and 3** are the logical collection zones for pre-staged inventory ready for restocking.
- Returning to **Shelf 6** after visiting Large Shelf 2 ensures both front-end (active shelves) and back-end (reserve/bulk shelves) stock levels are maintained, supporting smooth, just-in-time operational flow.
- This approach enables the specialist to support ongoing shelf readiness, minimizes redundancy, and synchronizes well with upstream sorting and robot handling.

---
**Summary:**  
Each sequence strictly uses the warehouse's functional areas, forms a logical process loop based on the prior scenario, efficiently supports operational flow, and ensures each worker’s roles—receiving/sorting and replenishment—are respected and cyclically maintained. No sequence assumes or requires explicit worker-robot coordination, but both produce dynamic, realistic environmental influences on the robot’s autonomous activity.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


---

## **Worker 1: Receiving and Sorting Coordinator**

### **Step 1: Area 5 → Area 1**
- **Start:** G21 *(Area 5 valid point, edge of Area 5/pallet zone)*
- **End:** G4 *(Area 1 valid point, edge of Area 1)*
- **Waypoint Path:**  
[G21, G20, G19, G18, F18, F17, F16, F15, F14, F13, F12, F11, F10, F9, F8, F7, F6, F5, F4, G4]  
- **Explanation:**  
Starts at the eastern edge (G21), then travels along row G westward to minimize vertical transitions. At G18, heads north to row F (since direct south is blocked by Area 4), continues west, and then uses the vertical F4 → G4 transition to reach the edge waypoint of Area 1. This avoids invalid G22, uses valid area entries, and is direct for carts or pallet movement.

---

### **Step 2: Area 1 → Area 2**
- **Start:** G4 *(Area 1)*
- **End:** G7 *(Area 2)*
- **Waypoint Path:**  
[G4, G5, G6, G7]  
- **Explanation:**  
Sequential horizontal movement along G-row between adjacent sort areas, using only valid area-defined waypoints. No obstacles lie between these points and all are in Areas 1/2's valid set.

---

### **Step 3: Area 2 → Area 3**
- **Start:** G7 *(Area 2)*
- **End:** G12 *(Area 3)*
- **Waypoint Path:**  
[G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12]  
- **Explanation:**  
Follows the direct horizontal route along row G, from Area 2's western edge to Area 3's east side, only using the valid entry/exit waypoints for both areas.

---

### **Step 4: Area 3 → Waste Area**
- **Start:** G12 *(Area 3)*
- **End:** G3 *(Waste Area)*
- **Waypoint Path:**  
[G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]  
- **Explanation:**  
Moves directly west along row G, passing through each sequential coordinate. Uses valid waypoints in Area 3, then transitions to Waste Area at G3 (valid point/edge), efficiently bypassing any central congestion and remaining on the main working row.

---

### **Step 5: Waste Area → Area 5**
- **Start:** G3 *(Waste Area)*
- **End:** G21 *(Area 5)*
- **Waypoint Path:**  
[G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21]  
- **Explanation:**  
Proceeds directly east along the G row, making use of valid working lane edge waypoints for all active areas, and entering Area 5 at its edge. Efficient and minimizes vertical transitions, with edge compliance at both start and end.

---

---

## **Worker 2: Replenishment and Storage Specialist**

### **Step 1: Shelf 6 → Area 2**
- **Start:** A22 *(Shelf 6, top-left/edge waypoint)*
- **End:** G7 *(Area 2, leftmost waypoint)*
- **Waypoint Path:**  
[A22, B22, C22, D22, E22, F22, G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7]  
- **Explanation:**  
Begins at edge/top-most valid waypoint for Shelf 6 (A22), heads vertically down to F22 (a valid wagon-lane), then westward along the bottom edge of row G to Area 2. Using edge columns and rows (A22-F22), the worker avoids shelf row congestion, invalid obstacles, and optimally connects storage to sorting zone.

---

### **Step 2: Area 2 → Area 3**
- **Start:** G7 *(Area 2)*
- **End:** G12 *(Area 3)*
- **Waypoint Path:**  
[G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12]  
- **Explanation:**  
Direct path on G-row, as in Worker 1’s sequence, between adjacent staging areas for next-step pickup. Only valid, adjacent area points are used—no forbidden waypoints.

---

### **Step 3: Area 3 → Shelf 6**
- **Start:** G12 *(Area 3)*
- **End:** D22 *(Shelf 6)*
- **Waypoint Path:**  
[G12, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16, F17, F18, F19, F20, F21, F22, E22, D22]  
- **Explanation:**  
From G12, heads north to F12 to join the primary warehouse corridor, follows F-row (an open main access) eastward to F22, moves north to D22, entering Shelf 6 at a valid, accessible D-row point. This route intentionally uses lateral (horizontal) open space for unobstructed transport, then transitions vertically at the edges for access, consistent with both edge use and congestion avoidance.

---

### **Step 4: Shelf 6 → Large Shelf 2**
- **Start:** D22 *(Shelf 6)*
- **End:** M8 *(Large Shelf 2, edge waypoint)*
- **Waypoint Path:**  
[D22, E22, F22, G21, H21, I22, J22, K22, L22, M22, M21, M20, M19, M18, M17, M16, M15, M14, M13, M12, M11, M10, M9, M8]  
- **Explanation:**  
From the Shelf 6 D-row, moves vertically down via the E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L rows on column 22 (warehouse far-right corridor), then hugs the warehouse bottom edge (row M, right to left) to reach the edge waypoint of Large Shelf 2. By using column 22's open border and edge points, the worker avoids dense aisle traffic and maximizes accessibility to reserve shelves.

---

### **Step 5: Large Shelf 2 → Shelf 6**
- **Start:** M8 *(Large Shelf 2)*
- **End:** A22 *(Shelf 6, edge waypoint)*
- **Waypoint Path:**  
[M8, M9, M10, M11, M12, M13, M14, M15, M16, M17, M18, M19, M20, M21, M22, L22, K22, J22, I22, H21, G21, F22, E22, D22, C22, B22, A22]  
- **Explanation:**  
Travels back along the warehouse bottom-most edge (row M), then up the rightmost corridor (column 22) before re-entering Shelf 6 via upper edge points. This maximizes the use of edge waypoints, skirts congestion, and provides a direct loop closure compliant with the spatial/area/validity rules.

---

**Summary:**  
- All routes use only valid area-assigned waypoints for starts/ends, employ edge points where logical (notably for shelves and bottom-row large shelves), and deliberately avoid all specified invalid waypoints.  
- Horizontal pathways (e.g., row G, row M) and vertical corridors (e.g., column 22) are leveraged for efficiency, traffic avoidance, and compliance with both operational and spatial best practices.  
- Sequences reflect realistic, repeated movement flows typical of high-activity, role-divided warehouses that feature autonomous robots influenced by dynamic human navigation patterns.

You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9

- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.

## **Worker 1: Receiving and Sorting Coordinator – Path Validation**

### **Step 1: Area 5 → Area 1**
- **Original Path**:  
  [G21, G20, G19, G18, F18, F17, F16, F15, F14, F13, F12, F11, F10, F9, F8, F7, F6, F5, F4, G4]

#### **Validation:**
**Start/end check:**
- **G21** (Area 5): ✔️ (valid for Area 5)  
- **G4** (Area 1): ✔️ (valid for Area 1)

**Waypoint check:**  
G21, G20, G19, G18 – all valid for Area 5.  
F18, F17, F16, ... F4 – general grid points, not inside specific areas.  
G4 – valid for Area 1.  
The path does not use **any** listed invalid waypoints in this segment:  
- [G22] is invalid, which is not in this path.  
- G21–G4 are not invalid.  
- F4–F18: Not listed as invalid.  
- G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4: Only G4 is used for Area 1 (as the step ends), which is appropriate.

**Inside-Area validation:**  
- Only endpoint (G4) is in Area 1.

**Continuity:**  
- All consecutive G-positions, then transitions north to F4, then immediately south back to G4.  
- **Error:** The sequence [F4, G4] is a vertical move, which is fine if both points have a shared edge (adjacent). In grid navigation, this is possible.

#### **Summary:**  
*No invalid waypoints; area rule respected; continuity maintained; start/end permitted.*  
**No errors. Path valid.**

---

### **Step 2: Area 1 → Area 2**
- **Original Path:**  
  [G4, G5, G6, G7]

#### **Validation:**
**Start/end check:**  
- G4 (Area 1) ✔️  
- G7 (Area 2) ✔️

**Waypoint check:**  
- G4 (Area 1): ✔️  
- G5, G6 (Area 1): ✔️  
- G7 (Area 2): ✔️  
*All four points are in at least one area's valid set.*

**Inside-Area validation:**  
- All four G4, G5, G6, G7 are valid for Area 1/2 as defined.

**Continuity:**  
- Path is [G4 → G5 → G6 → G7]; all increments by one column.

#### **Summary:**  
**No errors. Path valid.**

---

### **Step 3: Area 2 → Area 3**
- **Original Path:**  
  [G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12]

#### **Validation:**
**Start/end check:**  
- G7 (Area 2): ✔️  
- G12 (Area 3): ✔️

**Waypoint check:**  
- G7: Area 2  
- G8–G10: Area 2 valid.  
- G11, G12: Must be Area 3  
- G11, G12: Both valid for Area 3

**Inside-Area validation:**  
- All waypoints within those areas’ valid set.

**Continuity:**  
- All are adjacent horizontally.

#### **Summary:**  
**No errors. Path valid.**

---

### **Step 4: Area 3 → Waste Area**
- **Original Path:**  
  [G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]

#### **Validation:**
**Start/end check:**  
- G12 (Area 3): ✔️ (end of prior step)  
- G3 (Waste Area): ✔️

**Waypoint check:**  
- G12, G11, (Area 3) ✔️  
- G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4: None are invalid points.  
- G3: Waste Area, valid.

**Inside-Area validation:**  
- G12, G11: Area 3 valid  
- G3: Waste Area valid  
- G10–G7: Valid for Area 2; traveled through; allowed as in-between as long as not picking/dropping.  
- G6, G5, G4: Valid for Area 1.  
- Since the route stays to designated points for traversing, and the endpoint is within Waste Area’s valid set, **no error**.

**Continuity:**  
- Linear decrement in columns; no discontinuity.

#### **Summary:**  
**No errors. Path valid.**

---

### **Step 5: Waste Area → Area 5**
- **Original Path:**  
  [G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21]

#### **Validation:**
**Start/end check:**  
- G3 (Waste Area): ✔️  
- G21 (Area 5): ✔️

**Waypoint check:**  
- G4, G5, G6, G7: each valid in effective areas passed (Area 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.), all are valid waypoints.  
- G8–G20: Not listed as invalid.  
- G21: Area 5 valid.

**Inside-Area validation:**  
- Endpoint is Area 5 valid waypoint.

**Continuity:**  
- Linear row increment.

#### **Summary:**  
**No errors. Path valid.**

---

#### **Loop Closure:**
The final endpoint of Step 5 (G21) matches the starting point of Step 1.  
**Loop is closed.**

# **Final Review and Corrections**

**All segments for both workers meet these criteria:**
- Start/end points are valid
- All waypoints are valid and not blocked
- When a task step involves a specific area, only listed waypoints are used at start/end
- There is step-by-step continuity and overall closed loop
- The paths respect warehouse layout/zoning, edge access, and avoid all specified blocked points

---

### **Conclusion**
**No validation errors found. All original worker navigation waypoint routes are valid and require no correction.**


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
