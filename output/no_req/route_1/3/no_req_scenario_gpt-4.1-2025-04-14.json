  "scenario": "During a high-volume receiving period, Worker 1 transports incoming goods from the pallet jack to Area 1 for inspection, sorts items into Area 2 for storage or the Waste Area as needed, while Worker 2 collects inspected items from Area 2 (and Area 3 if overflow occurs) for putaway onto Shelf 5 or 6. Both workers frequently operate in close proximity within Areas 1–3 and along main corridors, often crossing paths and intermittently occupying shared zones. An autonomous robot, reacting only to physical changes in its environment, navigates from Area 3 to Shelf 6 to perform putaway. The robot’s movement is influenced by temporary human-induced obstructions along its route (e.g., workers present, carts, staged goods), prompting it to reroute or pause without direct human-robot interaction. This scenario realistically models a dynamic, high-activity warehouse workflow where autonomous and manual operations are interdependent but not directly coordinated.",
