  "scenario": "The warehouse is conducting simultaneous receiving, sorting, inspection, and replenishment operations. Worker 1 unloads pallets at Area 1/2, sorts items, and distributes them to Large Shelves or the Waste Area, regularly moving across the central corridor (F12–F18). Worker 2 inspects sorted goods in Areas 1/2, then transports and restocks items to Shelf 1–6, especially Shelf 6 (E21), often traversing the same main aisle. The autonomous robot detects a low stock at Shelf 6, collects items from Area 3 (G12), and follows the route G12 → F12 → F13 → F18 → E18 → E21 for delivery. Multiple legitimate workflow tasks cause workers to occupy or cross the robot’s path without any direct communication; the robot adapts its movement as needed based solely on their physical presence and environmental changes, leading to natural congestion and intermittent navigation delays.",
