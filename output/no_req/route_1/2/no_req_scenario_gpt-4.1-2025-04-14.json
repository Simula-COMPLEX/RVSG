  "scenario": "Worker 1 circulates between Large Shelves 1-2 in Region 4 and Areas 1-3 in Region 3, receiving and sorting incoming stock, staging them in Area 3 after initial checks. Worker 2 operates in Areas 2-3 for compliance inspection, then physically transfers cleared items from Area 3 to Shelf 6 in Region 2 via main corridor F12–E21, and moves rejects to the Waste Area. The autonomous robot, starting at G12 in Area 3, detects staged goods, picks one, and follows waypoints F12–E21 to deliver to Shelf 6; it pauses or reroutes if workers or their items temporarily block its path. Both human workers and the robot operate concurrently and independently, sharing pathways and workspace without direct communication, causing frequent indirect interaction and dynamic congestion typical of real warehouse workflows.",
