  "scenario": "During a peak operational window, Worker 1 receives new shipments at Area 5, checks goods, and transports them via central pathways to Area 2 and Area 3 for initial sorting and inspection. Damaged or unsuitable goods are carried to the Waste Area. Simultaneously, Worker 2 inspects and classifies items in Area 2 and Area 3, then transports approved stock along shared corridors to Shelf 6 for storage, overlapping with Worker 1 in central paths and staging zones. The autonomous robot, unaware of human intent, picks up a staged item from Area 3 and follows the main corridor to deliver it to Shelf 6, rerouting or pausing if workers or newly placed items block its waypoints. Throughout, frequent indirect interference—caused by shared space, simultaneous storage, and high space utilization—forces both robot and workers to constantly adapt, reflecting a realistic, busy, multi-actor warehouse workflow.",
