You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point G12 in Area 3, and travels rightward from row G to row E, moving from column 12 to column 21, and ends around E21 near Shelf 6. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: G12 → F12 → F13 → F14 → F15 → F16 → F17 → F18 → E18 → E19 → E20 → E21. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material transport task, picking up an item from Area 3 and delivering it to Shelf 6 for storage or replenishment.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis:**

### Warehouse Operational Use Case: Receiving, Sorting, and Storage with Overlapping Human and Robot Activities

#### Workflow Context
This scenario simulates a typical high-activity period in the warehouse, such as the start of a shift or post-delivery, where receiving, sorting, inspection, and storage all occur simultaneously. Both human workers and the autonomous robot must complete operationally required tasks in overlapping zones, often at the same time and along the same or intersecting pathways, but without direct communication or coordination.

---

#### Roles and Responsibilities

**Worker 1: Receiving & Primary Sorting**
- **Role Focus:** Handles inbound goods received at the entrance (near Area 5), transports these goods to the preliminary inspection and sorting zones, and initiates waste-handling for damaged/unsuitable items.
- **Route and Zones Used:**
  1. Begins at Area 5, where new shipments arrive—physically collects and checks packages.
  2. Moves items requiring inspection/sorting into Area 3 or Area 2.
  3. For waste or rejected goods, transports items to the Waste Area (F–J, 1–4).
  4. Frequently moves along Row F from Area 5 leftward (columns 20→5), uses vertical paths at columns 9 and 4 to access different areas, and occasionally overlaps with rows/areas used by the robot and Worker 2.

**Worker 2: Inspection, Placement & Restocking**
- **Role Focus:** Conducts detailed inspection, classification, and storage placement of sorted items. This includes placing goods onto shelves (specifically Shelf 6 and adjacent shelves) and managing the layout of inspected stock in the operational zones.
- **Route and Zones Used:**
  1. Operates between Area 2 and Area 3 (directly adjacent to robot’s navigation route) to inspect and sort items Worker 1 has delivered.
  2. Transports approved items from Area 3 to Shelf 6 (E21) or neighboring shelves for final storage.
  3. Frequently uses Row F (columns 12–21) and Row E (around columns 18–22), intersecting robot’s active route during delivery runs.
  4. May move toward Region 4 (Large Shelves) if handling bulky stock, using southward vertical transitions at column 9 or 22.

---

#### Robot Activity (Environmental Awareness Only)
- **Role:** Executes an autonomous material transfer.
- **Route:** Starts in Area 3 (G12) upon detecting a package staged by Worker 2 for storage. Travels eastward along Row F, then north to Shelf 6 (E21), where it places the item.
- **Environmental Dependencies:**
  - If human workers or new obstacles appear along the preplanned path (e.g., humans standing at a shared waypoint or depositing items), the robot autonomously replans by pausing or rerouting to use parallel waypoints—without explicit commands.
  - Repeatedly adapts as worker activity dynamically changes congestion or access to Shelf 6 (E21) or the main Row F corridor.

---

#### Key Zone Interactions and Overlap

- **Shared Facility Congestion Points:**
  1. **Area 3:** Both Worker 2 and the robot frequently occupy or pass through waypoints G12, F12–F17 as they stage or move items. Worker 1 may also enter this area during peak periods.
  2. **Pathways F and E:** Worker 1 uses these routes east–west to access all operational zones; Worker 2 and the robot both access Shelf 6 and interior shelves via the same corridors.
  3. **Shelf 6 Vicinity (E21):** Robot and Worker 2 may both arrive to store items or retrieve/stage stock, leading to temporary blockage or forced pauses at the shelf front.
  4. **Waste Area:** Worker 1 deposits waste here, possibly blocking quick access to Area 1 and adjacent paths used by other staff.

- **Operational Uncertainties:**
  - Delays may occur when both the robot and Worker 2 converge at Shelf 6.
  - Items being temporarily staged in Area 3 by either worker may change the robot’s navigation options without notice.
  - Worker 1 processing waste or large shipments might obstruct critical intersections at columns 4 or 9.

---

#### Realism and Process Flow

- **Why This Scenario Is Realistic:**
  - Multiple workflow stages (receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, waste management) occur in high-density zones, with human and robotic activity naturally converging.
  - Shared resource dependencies (operational areas, shelves, access paths) lead to indirect mutual interference—here, the robot must always sense and adapt its movement, as staff may unpredictably occupy critical points.
  - The role assignments (one focusing on inbound movement and waste, the other on inspection and final storage) are typical for small to mid-size warehouse environments, especially during restocking or shift changes.
  - The layout and navigational constraints force legitimate, frequent crossover—especially between operational zones (Areas 1–5) and storage points (Shelves 1–6, mainly Shelf 6), matching the designed process flows explained in the warehouse description.

### Scenario Summary in JSON Format

```json
{
  "scenario": "During a peak operational window, Worker 1 receives new shipments at Area 5, checks goods, and transports them via central pathways to Area 2 and Area 3 for initial sorting and inspection. Damaged or unsuitable goods are carried to the Waste Area. Simultaneously, Worker 2 inspects and classifies items in Area 2 and Area 3, then transports approved stock along shared corridors to Shelf 6 for storage, overlapping with Worker 1 in central paths and staging zones. The autonomous robot, unaware of human intent, picks up a staged item from Area 3 and follows the main corridor to deliver it to Shelf 6, rerouting or pausing if workers or newly placed items block its waypoints. Throughout, frequent indirect interference—caused by shared space, simultaneous storage, and high space utilization—forces both robot and workers to constantly adapt, reflecting a realistic, busy, multi-actor warehouse workflow."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**Reasoning and Task Sequence Design for Each Worker**

---

### Worker 1: Receiving & Primary Sorting

**Operational Role Recap:**  
Worker 1 is responsible for receiving inbound goods, performing an initial check, transporting items to operational zones for sorting/inspection, and handling waste. Their activity spans from the receipt area (Area 5), through sorting/inspection areas (primarily Area 2/Area 3), and involves the waste area for damaged or unsuitable goods. This cycle ensures a continual flow of incoming items through primary processing and removal of unusable materials.

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**

1. **Area 5 → Area 2:**  
   Start at Area 5 (receiving). Collect newly arrived goods and transport them to Area 2 for initial sorting.
   
2. **Area 2 → Area 3:**  
   Move inspected items requiring further classification or staging from Area 2 to Area 3 (additional sorting zone).
   
3. **Area 3 → Waste Area:**  
   Identify any damaged/unfit items during sorting in Area 3 and transfer them to the Waste Area for disposal.
   
4. **Waste Area → Area 5:**  
   Return from the Waste Area to Area 5, ready to receive the next shipment and restart the cycle.

**Reasoning:**  
This loop covers the full range of Worker 1’s duties: receiving (Area 5) → initial staging/sorting (Area 2) → deeper sorting (Area 3) → waste removal (Waste Area) → reset at receiving. The cycle maintains efficient throughput and supports high operational capacity, as it continually moves both usable and unusable materials efficiently through the warehouse, freeing up operational space for incoming shipments.


---

### Worker 2: Inspection, Placement & Restocking

**Operational Role Recap:**  
Worker 2 is focused on inspecting, classifying, and putting away usable inventory. They handle stock in Areas 2 and 3, then deliver items to storage (Shelf 6), returning to the inspection/sorting areas for the next batch.

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**

1. **Area 2 → Area 3:**  
   Start at Area 2 (inspection zone). Take inspected items and transfer them to Area 3 for staging/preparation for final storage.
   
2. **Area 3 → Shelf 6:**  
   Collect prepared items from Area 3 and move them to Shelf 6 for storage.
   
3. **Shelf 6 → Area 2:**  
   Return from Shelf 6 to Area 2, ready to repeat the inspection, classification, and preparation process.

**Reasoning:**  
This cycle ensures Worker 2 efficiently processes, stages, and stores inventory: starting and returning to the inspection area (Area 2), passing through staging (Area 3), and regularly replenishing storage (Shelf 6). It matches both the physical layout and the process workflow, supporting continuous restocking and smooth throughput from incoming to stored inventory.


---

**Summary Table**

| Worker  | Step 1           | Step 2         | Step 3       | Step 4       |
|---------|------------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Worker 1| Area 5 → Area 2  | Area 2 → Area 3| Area 3 → Waste Area | Waste Area → Area 5 |
| Worker 2| Area 2 → Area 3  | Area 3 → Shelf 6| Shelf 6 → Area 2 |              |


---

**How Each Sequence Supports Operational Goals:**
- **Worker 1’s loop** continuously clears inbound goods and waste, keeping operational zones free for new products, and ensures unusable materials do not accumulate, maintaining process flow.
- **Worker 2’s loop** cycles inspected/approved stock directly to storage, ensuring efficient throughput from staging to shelving while always returning to the inspection front for new items.
- **Both loops utilize shared functional areas (Area 2/Area 3)** in a way that naturally overlaps but reflects realistic, job-driven process needs, ensuring efficient and high-frequency use of inspection and staging spaces required for a busy operation.

---

**Summary:**
These cyclic task sequences reflect optimal routing, functional role alignment, and process flow within the physical constraints and workflow definitions of the warehouse scenario.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


---

**Worker 1: Receiving & Primary Sorting**

**Step 1: Area 5 → Area 2**  
- **Start:** G21 (Area 5 edge waypoint)  
- **End:** G9 (Area 2 edge waypoint)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9]  
- **Explanation:**  
  The path begins at an Area 5 edge waypoint (G21) and proceeds left along Row G, directly traversing Area 5 and operational zones. G9 is the nearest Area 2 waypoint to be reached horizontally via Row G. This route exclusively uses valid waypoints, avoids the G22 invalid waypoint, and leverages the edge starting/ending points per instruction, supporting direct access between the adjacent operational zones without unnecessary detours.

---

**Step 2: Area 2 → Area 3**  
- **Start:** G9 (Area 2 edge waypoint)  
- **End:** G12 (Area 3 edge waypoint)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [G9, G10, G11, G12]  
- **Explanation:**  
  This short route remains entirely on Row G, using only valid Area 2 and Area 3 waypoints. The start point G9 (edge of Area 2) directly connects through valid consecutive grid points to G12 (edge of Area 3), maximizing efficiency and simplicity.

---

**Step 3: Area 3 → Waste Area**  
- **Start:** G12 (Area 3 edge waypoint)  
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area edge waypoint)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]  
- **Explanation:**  
  The route uses only valid Row G waypoints for Area 3 and the Waste Area, moving leftward. G3 is the Waste Area edge point; this direct horizontal path avoids all invalid points and maximizes operational efficiency, especially during busy warehouse periods.

---

**Step 4: Waste Area → Area 5**  
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area edge waypoint)  
- **End:** G21 (Area 5 edge waypoint)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21]  
- **Explanation:**  
  The loop is closed by traversing the entire length of Row G from the Waste Area back to Area 5’s edge. All used waypoints are valid; G21 is specifically listed as an Area 5 edge. This efficient, linear path supports continuous looped operation, essential for high-throughput waste and receiving cycles.

---

**Worker 2: Inspection, Placement & Restocking**

**Step 1: Area 2 → Area 3**  
- **Start:** G9 (Area 2 edge waypoint)  
- **End:** G12 (Area 3 edge waypoint)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [G9, G10, G11, G12]  
- **Explanation:**  
  As in Worker 1’s Step 2, this remains the most direct and efficient path using only valid waypoints, allowing for rapid transfer of inspected items between closely aligned work zones.

---

**Step 2: Area 3 → Shelf 6**  
- **Start:** G12 (Area 3 edge waypoint)  
- **End:** A22 (Shelf 6 edge waypoint, warehouse boundary)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [G12, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12, A12, A14, A16, A18, A20, A22]  
- **Explanation:**  
  The path leverages vertical movement from G12 to A12 (via the F–A range of column 12), which is valid for both Area 3 and Shelf 1. From A12, it moves laterally across the valid edge points at Row A, progressing through A14, A16, A18, A20, and finally to the explicit edge of Shelf 6 at A22. All waypoints are valid and strategically include edge points (Row A), maximizing route efficiency for high-traffic shelving at the boundary and bypassing invalid waypoints (such as A13, A15, A17, A19, A21).

---

**Step 3: Shelf 6 → Area 2**  
- **Start:** A22 (Shelf 6 edge waypoint)  
- **End:** G9 (Area 2 edge waypoint)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [A22, B22, C22, D22, E22, F22, G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9]  
- **Explanation:**  
  This route starts at the Row A edge waypoint of Shelf 6 (A22), proceeds directly down column 22 (using valid points on each row), and, upon reaching G21 (valid for Area 5), travels left along Row G through the Area 5 perimeter and toward Area 2. This path carefully uses edge points and only valid waypoints for both vertical and horizontal movement, elegantly circumventing the invalid waypoints stipulated for adjacent columns and ensuring complete compliance with navigation rules.

**Route design strictly follows all requirements: All area valid waypoints are used as start/end points, edge waypoints at rows A/B and G21 are leveraged for maximum efficiency, and all invalid waypoints are avoided. This results in compliant, efficient, and realistic worker navigation fully integrated with the warehouse layout and operations.**


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.


==================================================


Below is a **detailed validation and correction** of each path segment for both Worker 1 and Worker 2, in strict accordance with all provided requirements.

---

## Worker 1

### Step 1: Area 5 → Area 2  
- **Planned Start:** G21 (Area 5 valid)  
- **Planned End:** G9 (Area 2 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9]

#### Validation:
- **Start (G21):** Valid for Area 5.
- **End (G9):** Valid for Area 2.
- **Waypoints in Area 5:** G21, G20, G19, G18 — All valid (Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21).
- **Waypoints in Area 2:** G9, G10 — Both valid (Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10).
- **Waypoints between areas:** G17–G11 are not listed in any area’s valid waypoints, and thus cross open, non-designated grid points. However, unless G11 or G12 are blocked, these are technically valid navigational waypoints.
- **Crosschecking G row invalids:** G1, G2, G22—none in path => OK.

#### **Conclusion:**
- All points are valid waypoints and not on the blocked list.
- Edge points (G21 for Area 5, G9 for Area 2) are being used.
- Path is continuous.
- **NO ERRORS.**

---

### Step 2: Area 2 → Area 3  
- **Planned Start:** G9 (Area 2 valid)  
- **Planned End:** G12 (Area 3 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [G9, G10, G11, G12]

#### Validation:
- **Start (G9):** Valid for Area 2.
- **End (G12):** Valid for Area 3.
- **In-area waypoints:**
  - G9, G10 (Area 2; both listed),
  - G11, G12 (Area 3; both listed).
- **All waypoints:** Not marked as blocked.
- **Continuity:** Consecutive columns on Row G.

#### **Conclusion:**
- Proper transition at exact permitted waypoints for each area.
- **NO ERRORS.**

---

### Step 3: Area 3 → Waste Area  
- **Planned Start:** G12 (Area 3 valid)  
- **Planned End:** G3 (Waste Area valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]

#### Validation:
- **Start (G12):** Valid for Area 3.
- **End (G3):** Valid for Waste Area.
- **Area 3 waypoints:** G12, G11 (both permitted for Area 3).
- **Waste Area waypoint:** G3 (permitted for Waste Area).
- **Waypoints G10–G4:** These are not valid for any area except possibly G4 (Area 1), but not listed as valid for Waste Area or Area 3. However, for navigation between open operational space, unless listed as invalid, these may be traversed.
- **Row G invalids check:** G1, G2, G22—none in path.

#### **Conclusion:**
- All waypoints are valid for navigation; “in-area” requirement is respected where applicable (Area 3: G12, G11; Waste Area: G3).
- **NO ERRORS.**

---

### Step 4: Waste Area → Area 5  
- **Planned Start:** G3 (Waste Area valid)  
- **Planned End:** G21 (Area 5 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21]

#### Validation:
- **Start (G3):** Waste Area valid.
- **End (G21):** Area 5 valid.
- **Inter-area waypoints:** 
  - G18–G21: Area 5 valid.
  - G4: Area 1 valid.
  - The rest (G5–G17) are valid general navigation points, not marked as blocked.
- **Row G blocked check:** G1, G2, G22—none used.

#### **Conclusion:**
- Start and end valid, all waypoints unblocked, in-area valid waypoints used as needed.
- **NO ERRORS.**

---

### **Worker 1 path continuity and loop:**
- End of each segment is the exact start of the next.
- The end of the last segment (G21) matches the start of the first, forming a closed loop.

---

## Worker 2

### Step 1: Area 2 → Area 3  
- **Planned Start:** G9 (Area 2 valid)  
- **Planned End:** G12 (Area 3 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [G9, G10, G11, G12]

#### Validation:
- Same as Worker 1 Step 2.
- **NO ERRORS.**

---

### Step 2: Area 3 → Shelf 6  
- **Planned Start:** G12 (Area 3 valid)  
- **Planned End:** A22 (Shelf 6 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [G12, F12, E12, D12, C12, B12, A12, A14, A16, A18, A20, A22]

#### Validation:
- **Start (G12):** Area 3 valid.
- **G12 → F12:** F12 is not listed as a valid waypoint for Area 3, but it is not on the blocked list. F12 is not “in-area,” but is valid for travel.
- **D12, C12, B12, A12:** Shelf 1 area valid waypoints.
- **A14, A16, A18, A20, A22:** These are all valid only for Shelves 2-6. Need to verify none of these are in the "invalid" list for Row A: A13, A15, A17, A19, A21 (all these are skipped; A14, A16, A18, A20, A22 are OK).
- **End (A22):** Shelf 6 area valid.

- **Area-valid-waypoint rule:** Path only needs to start/end with area-designated waypoints; it's acceptable to traverse open valid waypoints not listed for a specific area when not in that area.

#### **Conclusion:**
- All waypoints legally traversable. Uses edge (A22).
- Path is continuous, no invalids.
- **NO ERRORS.**

---

### Step 3: Shelf 6 → Area 2  
- **Planned Start:** A22 (Shelf 6 valid)  
- **Planned End:** G9 (Area 2 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [A22, B22, C22, D22, E22, F22, G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9]

#### Validation:
- **Start (A22):** Shelf 6 valid.
- **A22 → G21:** Each of these is not on the blocked list. A22, B22, C22, D22 are listed for Shelf 6. E22, F22 may be valid as general navigation waypoints (F22 is Pallet Jack valid waypoint, E22 is not listed specifically, but not blocked). G21 is an Area 5 valid waypoint.
- **G21 → G9:** All are on Row G and, as above, none are blocked. G9 is Area 2 valid.
- **Area-valid-waypoint rule:** Area start/end points correct; waypoints for traversal are not required to be area-specific if only passing through.

#### **Conclusion:**  
- All waypoints valid. Edge and area waypoints used for start/end.  
- **NO ERRORS.**

---

### **Worker 2 path continuity and loop:**
- End of each segment matches start of next.
- The last waypoint (G9) matches the initial start (G9), forming a closed loop.

---

## **Overall Compliance, Error Listing, and Corrections**
**NO ERRORS FOUND** in any of the planned segments.  
- All paths start and end at valid area waypoints.
- All waypoints within each area-mandated step are from that area's list, where the step is "in-area."
- All traversed intermediate points are not on the invalid list and are valid for transit.
- All segment transitions are continuous.
- Each sequence returns to its initial starting point.

**NO CORRECTIONS NEEDED.**
Each route as planned is valid, efficient, continuous, area-compliant, and closed-loop as required.

You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
