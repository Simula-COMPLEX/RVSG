  "scenario": "A busy receiving and sorting operation is underway following a shipment arrival. Worker 1 handles unloading and initial sorting of new boxes from Region 1 (Boxes 1–3), moving goods to operational Area 1 or appropriate storage. Worker 2 inspects and processes items staged in Areas 1 and 2, redirecting them to shelves, large shelves, or the Waste Area as needed. Both workers use the main corridors and operational areas, often crossing paths or working simultaneously in Area 1 and along key waypoints (E9 to G4). An autonomous robot, triggered solely by environmental changes, transfers material from Shelf 1 (A9) to Area 1 (G4), adjusting its navigation in real time when boxes or workers block its path. Pathway congestion, shared use of tools like the pallet jack, and overlapping spatial activity create operationally realistic, workflow-driven human-robot and human-human congestion, requiring the robot to frequently adapt to dynamic obstacles while workers complete tasks vital to process flow.",
