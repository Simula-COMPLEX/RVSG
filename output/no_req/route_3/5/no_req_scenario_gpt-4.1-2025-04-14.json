  "scenario": "Worker A unloads new inventory at the warehouse, transporting items from the receiving dock to Area 1 for initial sorting and moving unusable materials to the Waste Area. Worker B concurrently inspects and sorts items in Area 1, restocking shelves or large shelves as needed and occasionally disposing of rejected goods. An autonomous robot independently transfers a package from Shelf 1 to Area 1 using the primary grid corridor; its movement is affected only when workers or objects block its predefined navigation path. All roles require frequent movement in and around Area 1 and main aisles, resulting in routine, indirect interference as workers and robots compete for access to shared pathways and sorting zones.",
