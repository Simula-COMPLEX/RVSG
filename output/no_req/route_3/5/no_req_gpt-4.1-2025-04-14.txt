========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point A9, close to Shelf 1, and travels leftward from row A to row G, moving from column 9 to column 4, and ends around G4 in Area 1. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: A9 → B9 → C9 → D9 → E9 → E8 → E7 → F7 → F6 → F5 → G4. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material relocation task, picking up an item from Shelf 1 and delivering it to Area 1 for sorting, inspection, or further processing.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis**

**Operational Use Case:**
The warehouse is engaged in a high-throughput operation involving the simultaneous receiving, preliminary inspection, and internal reallocation of incoming shipments. In this scenario, two human workers (Worker A and Worker B) and an autonomous robot collaboratively—but independently—facilitate these processes, frequently sharing space in key areas to meet efficiency demands. The workflow requires physical movement across multiple regions, shared use of storage and operational zones, and frequent interaction with the environment (but not direct communication or coordination).

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

**Worker A – Receiving & Preliminary Sorting:**
- **Primary task:** Unload incoming pallets and packages from the loading dock, then deliver incoming inventory to the designated receiving/sorting zones.
- **Movement:** 
  - Begins with unloading at the lower left entrance (near the Waste Area, F1-F4, G1-G4).
  - Moves packages directly to Area 1 or Area 2 in Region 3 (F5-G8), where they undergo a preliminary check. 
  - If items are deemed non-usable, Worker A moves them to the Waste Area (F1-G4).
  - Periodically uses the pallet jack (G22) for larger loads, picking it up from its station and navigating central corridors (E/L rows, 9/22 columns).
- **Overlap:** Frequently moves between Waste Area, Area 1, Area 2, and the central aisles, crossing over prime traffic routes used by the robot.

**Worker B – Inspection, Restocking, and Redistribution:**
- **Primary task:** Conducts detailed checks on items in Area 1 or Area 2, then restocks shelves (Region 2: Shelf 1-6) or large shelves (Region 4: Large Shelf 1-4) as required by inventory rules.
- **Movement:**
  - Begins at inspection zones (Area 1/Area 2, F5-G8).
  - Retrieves items ready for storage from preliminary sort, then transports them north to Region 2 shelves (A-E, 10-22) or south to Region 4 (L-M, 1-22) via central corridors.
  - Occasionally deposits rejected items in Waste Area (F1-G4), but spends most time moving between Areas 1/2, shelves, and large shelves.
- **Overlap:** Routinely crosses the robot’s path, especially when restocking Shelf 1 (A9) or moving between operational areas via the main grid.

**Robot – Autonomous Shelf-to-Sorting Transfer:**
- **Primary task:** Relocate specific items from Shelf 1 (A9) in Region 2 to Area 1 (G4) for inspection/sorting, following a defined waypoint navigation route (A9 → G4) through shared central corridors.
- **Environmental Interaction:** The robot is not aware of human worker intentions, nor does it receive direct instruction. Its progress is only influenced when:
  - Worker A or B moves a cart, pallet, or themselves into its path, causing the robot to stop, reroute, or wait.
  - Temporary physical obstacles (packages staged in aisles, repositioned pallet jack, misplaced waste) block the intended waypoints.
  - Area 1 (G4 region) is full, requiring the robot to hold position or wait until space is cleared by Worker B.
- **No Direct Coordination:** If a human places a load in Area 1 or occupies a major aisle, the robot reacts by sensing and adapting to the new environmental constraint, pausing or re-routing around the obstruction.

**Operational Realism:**
- The use of a shared Area 1 for both transfer (robot) and inspection/sorting (humans) is typical in high-activity warehousing.
- Frequent cross-traffic along Route E9-G4 is highly realistic as both robot and workers need access to central shelves and sort zones.
- Roles reflect industry-standard receiving/sorting/restocking processes, with workers often tasked with overlapping inspection and internal logistics functions.
- The robot’s lack of intent awareness about human activities, requiring real-time adaptation to dynamic obstructions, fits the real-life limitation of current fully autonomous warehouse robots.
- Workers periodically needing the pallet jack, sharing waste area access, and performing iterative back-and-forth movements mirrors actual warehouse activity surges and the challenge of spatial congestion.

**Scenario JSON Summary (output this only as the last part, separate from analysis):**
```json
{
  "scenario": "Worker A unloads new inventory at the warehouse, transporting items from the receiving dock to Area 1 for initial sorting and moving unusable materials to the Waste Area. Worker B concurrently inspects and sorts items in Area 1, restocking shelves or large shelves as needed and occasionally disposing of rejected goods. An autonomous robot independently transfers a package from Shelf 1 to Area 1 using the primary grid corridor; its movement is affected only when workers or objects block its predefined navigation path. All roles require frequent movement in and around Area 1 and main aisles, resulting in routine, indirect interference as workers and robots compete for access to shared pathways and sorting zones."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**Worker A – Cyclic Task Sequence & Reasoning**

**Sequence:**  
1. **Waste Area → Boxes 1**  
   _Starts at the Waste Area to emulate real-world breaks or end-of-cycle checks before beginning their receiving route, then proceeds to collect new stock from Boxes 1 (bulk incoming)._

2. **Boxes 1 → Area 1**  
   _Transports selected items from bulk storage to the initial sorting zone, fulfilling the receiving and delivery role._

3. **Area 1 → Waste Area**  
   _Removes non-usable or damaged items identified during unloading or initial checks directly to the Waste Area as part of proper materials handling._

4. **Waste Area → Pallet Jack**  
   _Fetches the pallet jack after waste removal, needed for pooled or bulk transfer of heavier items._

5. **Pallet Jack → Boxes 1**  
   _Returns to pick up more bulk items using the pallet jack, ready to repeat the cycle._

**Reasoning:**  
This cycle emphasizes Worker A’s responsibilities: receiving inventory, ensuring bad stock is disposed of, and preparing for the next batch by returning to the source with proper equipment. By cycling through Boxes 1, Area 1, and the Waste Area, Worker A repeatedly feeds the sorting/inspection area while also managing unusable goods, supporting high throughput and minimizing clutter in operational zones.

---

**Worker B – Cyclic Task Sequence & Reasoning**

**Sequence:**  
1. **Area 1 → Shelf 1**  
   _Starts at Area 1 to inspect or pick sorted items, then transports them for stocking to Shelf 1 (or other shelves as required, but represented here as Shelf 1 for cyclic consistency)._

2. **Shelf 1 → Area 1**  
   _Returns from the shelf to Area 1 to pick up more items or address the next batch of goods awaiting inspection and redistribution._

3. **Area 1 → Large Shelf 1**  
   _Transports larger or bulk-designated items to Large Shelf 1, supporting differentiated storage requirements after inspection._

4. **Large Shelf 1 → Area 1**  
   _Returns to Area 1 to cycle again through the inspection and sorting responsibilities._

**Reasoning:**  
Worker B’s sequence alternates between Area 1, Shelf 1, and Large Shelf 1, aligning with the role of inspecting, sorting, and restocking. By continuously cycling back to Area 1 after stocking or moving items, Worker B ensures Area 1 remains available for new incoming goods from Worker A and from the robot. This loop maintains efficient item flow to frequently accessed and bulk storage zones, supporting sustained operation, inventory accuracy, and minimal delay during high-activity periods.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


**Worker A – Detailed Navigation Routes**

---

**Task 1: Waste Area → Boxes 1**  
- **Start coordinate:** F3 (Waste Area)  
- **End coordinate:** E1 (Boxes 1)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [F3, E3, E2, E1]  
- **Explanation:**  
  F3 (Waste Area) links directly north to E3 (Boxes 1, shared valid point with E3). From E3, move left (west) through E2 to E1 (an edge waypoint in Boxes 1), leveraging the edge to access the bulk goods at the far left without traversing central aisles. The route is valid, short, avoids obstructions, and utilizes the shared waypoint at E3 for smooth zone transition.

---

**Task 2: Boxes 1 → Area 1**  
- **Start coordinate:** E1 (Boxes 1)  
- **End coordinate:** G4 (Area 1)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [E1, E2, E3, F3, F4, G4]  
- **Explanation:**  
  Starting at the leftmost edge of Boxes 1 (E1), the route travels east to E3 (shared with Waste Area), then south to F3, bypassing invalid F1/F2. From F3, moving east to F4 (central corridor), then south to G4 (the northwest edge of Area 1), which is an Area 1 valid point. This is the most direct valid approach while exclusively using permitted waypoints, emphasizing edge and transition access.

---

**Task 3: Area 1 → Waste Area**  
- **Start coordinate:** G4 (Area 1)  
- **End coordinate:** F3 (Waste Area)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [G4, F4, F3]  
- **Explanation:**  
  Exits Area 1's edge point G4 north to F4, then west to F3 into the Waste Area, moving along the shortest valid crossing between operational zones, and carefully remains clear of any invalid waypoints in Row G. F3 is the main operational point for Waste Area drop-offs.

---

**Task 4: Waste Area → Pallet Jack**  
- **Start coordinate:** F3 (Waste Area)  
- **End coordinate:** F22 (Pallet Jack)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16, F17, F18, F19, F20, F21, F22]  
- **Explanation:**  
  This route follows the unobstructed central corridor along F-row, directly from the low-numbered columns to the far right edge (Column 22, where the Pallet Jack is stationed). F22 acts as a Pallet Jack valid point on the edge, supporting equipment retrieval without crossing obstacles or ambiguous areas.

---

**Task 5: Pallet Jack → Boxes 1**  
- **Start coordinate:** F22 (Pallet Jack)  
- **End coordinate:** E1 (Boxes 1)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [F22, F21, F20, F19, F18, F17, F16, F15, F14, F13, F12, F11, F10, F9, F8, F7, F6, F5, F4, F3, E3, E2, E1]  
- **Explanation:**  
  This is the reverse of the previous east-west route, from the extreme right (F22, Pallet Jack edge) straight west along the F-row central aisle, then up to E3 (shared access for Boxes 1), and west along E2 to return to the leftmost storage at E1. This route provides continuous unobstructed bulk item retrieval along a main corridor, maximizing speed and minimizing interference.

---

**Worker B – Detailed Navigation Routes**

---

**Task 1: Area 1 → Shelf 1**  
- **Start coordinate:** G4 (Area 1)  
- **End coordinate:** A9 (Shelf 1)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [G4, F4, E4, D4, C4, B4, A9]  
- **Explanation:**  
  From the bottom-left of Area 1 (G4), the route proceeds north via F4 and then east from E4 through the central vertical corridor, using only valid waypoints, to reach A9—a valid edge location for Shelf 1. By following aisle F4 → E4 (up), it accesses the shelf's outermost edge (A9), making this a highly efficient and least disruptive path to high-frequency storage at a zone boundary. It does not cross any invalid points.

---

**Task 2: Shelf 1 → Area 1**  
- **Start coordinate:** A9 (Shelf 1)  
- **End coordinate:** G4 (Area 1)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [A9, B4, C4, D4, E4, F4, G4]  
- **Explanation:**  
  This is the return journey, retracing the previous route in the opposite direction to return to Area 1. Using edge points (A9, a shelf edge), Worker B can rapidly move between storage and operational zones without detours, directly supporting the cyclical workflow. The path maximizes the use of valid, unobstructed waypoints.

---

**Task 3: Area 1 → Large Shelf 1**  
- **Start coordinate:** G4 (Area 1)  
- **End coordinate:** M2 (Large Shelf 1)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [G4, H4, I4, J4, K4, L3, M2]  
- **Explanation:**  
  The path travels directly south from Area 1 (G4 is an edge), through rows H, I, and J at column 4—all valid (see Area 1 and general grid). From J4, move diagonally through K4 to L3 and then further south to M2, an edge valid point on Large Shelf 1. This approach gives rapid, direct access to the edge of the large shelf zone while avoiding invalid grid points in lower rows.

---

**Task 4: Large Shelf 1 → Area 1**  
- **Start coordinate:** M2 (Large Shelf 1)  
- **End coordinate:** G4 (Area 1)  
- **Waypoint path:**  
  [M2, L3, K4, J4, I4, H4, G4]  
- **Explanation:**  
  The return journey retraces the southbound transfer, moving from M2 (Large Shelf 1, edge) north via L3, then directly up the column through K4/J4 and into Area 1 at G4 (north edge, operational zone). This is the most efficient and direct valid way, designed for high-frequency transit into the core sorting zone with zero obstacle overlap.

---

**Summary:**  
All routes leverage the detailed area waypoints, make use of edge (perimeter) points wherever defined and valid, and are efficient while strictly avoiding all listed invalid waypoints. They support continual workflow loops, rapid zone transfers, and maintain clear, accessible pathways for simultaneous use by workers and autonomous robot, thus maximizing warehouse throughput and safety without contrived blocking or forced detouring.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.

### Worker B

#### **Task 1: Area 1 → Shelf 1**
- **Original Path:** [G4, F4, E4, D4, C4, B4, A9]

**Validation:**
- **Start (G4, Area 1):** Valid.
- **End (A9, Shelf 1):** Valid.
- **Waypoints:**
    - G4: Valid (Area 1).
    - F4, E4, D4, C4, B4: Are these valid?
        - B4: **Invalid** (Row B: B4 is in the invalid list).
        - C4: **Invalid** (Row C: C4 is in the invalid list).
        - D4: **Invalid** (Row D: D4 is in the invalid list).
    - Only A9 (Shelf 1) is allowed as entry, but intermediate B4, C4, D4 are blocked.
- **Invalid Waypoint Check:**  
    - B4, C4, D4 are invalid.
- **In-area waypoints:**  
    - Only A9 for Shelf 1 (valid).
- **Continuity:** Path is continuous but traverses invalid points.

**Correction Proposal:**
- **Valid Shelf 1 Access Points:** A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- **Entry path from G4 (Area 1 valid):**
    - Move from G4 to F4 up to E4 (still valid), then east on E-row past E5 to E9, up E9 → D9 → C9 → B9 → A9.
    - But need to avoid invalid E9, D9, C9, B9 if not in the invalid list. Check their validity:
        - E9: Not in list of invalids for E-row (not present, so valid).
        - D9, C9, B9: Not in invalid list for respective rows.
    - Path leveraging E4→E9, then north.
- **Proposed Path:** [G4, F4, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9, D9, C9, B9, A9]

**Check against valid area lookups:**  
- **Area 1:** G4  
- **Shelf 1:** B9, A9  
- **Rest:** transitions, all valid, per the global list and no invalid points listed.

**Result:**  
**Errors found (B4, C4, D4 invalid).**  
**Corrected Path:** [G4, F4, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9, D9, C9, B9, A9]

---

#### **Task 2: Shelf 1 → Area 1**
- **Original Path:** [A9, B4, C4, D4, E4, F4, G4]

**Validation:**
- **Start (A9, Shelf 1):** Valid.
- **End (G4, Area 1):** Valid.
- **Waypoints:**  
    - From A9, path jumps to B4 (**Invalid**), C4 (**Invalid**), D4 (**Invalid**) etc.
- **Invalid Waypoints:** B4, C4, D4 invalid.
- **Corrected Route:**
    - Reverse of above: From A9, go south via B9, C9, D9 to E9, then west to E4, down to F4, G4.
    - Path: [A9, B9, C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, E5, E4, F4, G4]

**Check against valid area waypoints:**
- **Shelf 1:** A9, B9, C9, D9
- **Area 1:** G4

**Result:**  
**Errors found (B4, C4, D4 invalid).**  
**Corrected Path:** [A9, B9, C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, E5, E4, F4, G4]

#### **Task 3: Area 1 → Large Shelf 1**
- **Original Path:** [G4, H4, I4, J4, K4, L3, M2]

**Validation:**
- **Start (G4, Area 1):** Valid.
- **End (M2, Large Shelf 1):** Valid.
- **Waypoints:**
    - G4 (Area 1)
    - H4 (check Area 1: not valid for Area 1, but if it’s a through-point, permitted)
        - H4 not in invalids for Row H.
    - I4, J4: same as above, not listed as invalid.
    - K4, L3: Not listed as invalid.
    - M2: Valid (Large Shelf 1).

**However:**  
- If any waypoint is inside an area, it must be in that area's list.  
- G4 is the only Area 1 waypoint visited at the start.  
- Large Shelf 1: Only M2 as end.  
- All intermediate points are transitions and not area-specific (not in a restricted list for any areas traversed).

**Check for invalid waypoints:**
- G4: valid  
- H4: Row H’s invalids are H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22—not H4. Valid.
- I4: Row I's invalids are I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10—not I4. Valid.
- J4: Row J’s invalids are J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10—not J4. Valid.
- K4, L3: Both not in any invalid list.  
- M2: Valid.

**Result:**  
**No errors. Route is valid.**

#### **Task 4: Large Shelf 1 → Area 1**
- **Original Path:** [M2, L3, K4, J4, I4, H4, G4]

**Validation:**
- **Start (M2, Large Shelf 1):** Valid.
- **End (G4, Area 1):** Valid.
- **Waypoints:**  
    - M2: Valid (Large Shelf 1)
    - L3, K4, J4, I4, H4, G4: Same as above, and all are valid.

**Check for in-area waypoints:**  
- Only M2 (Large Shelf 1) and G4 (Area 1), and both are listed as valid for their respective zones.

**Result:**  
**No errors. Route is valid.**

---

#### **Closed loop check (Worker B):**
- Task 1 end = Task 2 start = Task 3 start = Task 4 end = G4 (Area 1)
- Task 4 end: G4
- Task 1 start: G4  
**-> The loop closes.**

### Conclusion:
- **Worker A's routes are fully valid as provided.**
- **Worker B's Task 1 and 2 used invalid B4, C4, and D4 waypoints; corrected to use only valid points and area-approved access, still efficiently serving the same function.**
- **All corrected paths respect closed loops, continuity, functional area rules, and physical constraints.**

You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
