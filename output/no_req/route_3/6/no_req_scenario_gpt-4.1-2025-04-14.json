  "scenario": "Two human workers operate in parallel and overlapping workflows during an inbound receive-and-sort shift. Worker 1 unloads and stages new shipments from Boxes 1–3, moving goods down the main aisle to Area 1 for sorting and initial inspection, and occasionally discards waste in the Waste Area. Worker 2 inspects, repackages, and sorts items in Area 1/2, then transports them to either Shelf 1–3 or Large Shelf 1–2 as appropriate. Both workers frequently pass through central corridors and may occupy Area 1 together, leading to spatial congestion and temporary obstructions. Meanwhile, an autonomous robot picks items from Shelf 1 and carries them along the shared E-row corridor to Area 1, dropping off packages for inspection. The robot autonomously avoids obstacles posed by workers or staged goods, with all task overlap and indirect interference arising from normal workflow activities rather than intentional disruption or direct communication.",
