  "scenario": "During a high-inbound period, Worker A receives incoming pallets at Large Shelf 1, transports them via pallet jack to Area 1 for unloading and sorting, and diverts damaged goods to the Waste Area as needed. Worker B, stationed in Area 1, inspects, labels, and forwards items to shelves or dispatch zones, regularly moving between Area 1, Region 2 shelves, and Region 4 shelves. The autonomous robot retrieves high-frequency items from Shelf 1 and delivers them to Area 1 for rapid processing. Both workers operate in overlapping timeframes, frequently sharing corridor space and occasionally occupying the same waypoints as the robot, which adjusts its route in real time based on their presence and activity, but without any direct communication or coordination. This creates a realistic dynamic of workflow congestion, parallel processes, and autonomous-but-reactive robot navigation in a busy warehouse.",
