  "scenario": "During a busy inbound shift, Worker 1 transports incoming boxes from the receiving area to Area 1 for initial sorting, frequently moving between Area 1 and Area 2 to manage overflow and organize items for inspection. At the same time, Worker 2 performs quality checks on boxes in Area 1 and Area 2, carrying approved items to Shelf 2–4 for storage and periodically transporting rejected items to the Waste Area. Both workers repeatedly move through and operate in the same functional areas, especially near Area 1, creating frequent temporary blockages and spatial congestion along the main corridors and access points. The robot autonomously travels between Shelf 1 and Area 1 along its designated waypoint route, relocating items as assigned. It adapts to the evolving environment solely by pausing or rerouting in response to workers’ physical presence or the placement of boxes that obstruct its path, with no direct communication or intentional coordination between human and robot. This operational arrangement reflects typical high-activity warehouse conditions, with overlapping, complementary workflows, shared zone congestion, and autonomous navigation adaption driven by actual workspace dynamics.",
