  "scenario": "During a morning receiving operation, Worker 1 unloads and sorts goods from a newly arrived pallet in Area 5 using the pallet jack, then moves items into Areas 1 and 2 for sorting and inspection, while placing waste in the Waste Area. Meanwhile, Worker 2 retrieves sorted items from Areas 1 and 2 for restocking on shelves (Shelf 1–6) and bulk boxes (Boxes 1–3), occasionally clearing packaging to the Waste Area and returning oversized items to large shelves in Region 4. Both workers frequently pass through central corridors and share workspace in Areas 1, 2, and Waste, often occupying the same zone at different or overlapping times. A robot, operating autonomously and without any direct human interaction, is tasked to relocate items from Shelf 1 to Area 1. Its path crosses shared zones, and if a worker or temporary load blocks a waypoint or shelf access, the robot pauses or adapts its route based solely on sensor detection of these new obstacles, resuming only when its path is clear. This generates a realistic environment of spatial congestion and indirect, environmental-based robot response amid active, high-frequency human workflows.",
