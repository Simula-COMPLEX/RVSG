  "scenario": "During peak receiving hours, Worker 1 transports newly arrived goods from the warehouse entrance or Region 4 (Large Shelves) to Area 1 or Area 2 for initial sorting, moving frequently between staging, storage, and the Waste Area for disposal tasks. Simultaneously, Worker 2 inspects sorted items in Area 1 or Area 2, restocking passable goods into assigned storage (Boxes 1–3, Shelves 1–6, or Large Shelves 1–4) and taking rejected items to the Waste Area. Both workers repeatedly occupy or cross through Areas 1 and 2, central corridors, and waste disposal points, resulting in frequent, unscripted spatial overlap. Meanwhile, an autonomous robot retrieves an item from Shelf 1 and follows a route to deliver it to Area 1 for inspection. The robot dynamically reacts to temporary obstructions or occupied waypoints caused by the workers' presence—pausing or rerouting as needed—without direct human-robot interaction, ensuring uninterrupted workflow and demonstrating realistic shared-space warehouse operations.",
