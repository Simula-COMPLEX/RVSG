========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point A9, close to Shelf 1, and travels leftward from row A to row G, moving from column 9 to column 4, and ends around G4 in Area 1. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: A9 → B9 → C9 → D9 → E9 → E8 → E7 → F7 → F6 → F5 → G4. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material relocation task, picking up an item from Shelf 1 and delivering it to Area 1 for sorting, inspection, or further processing.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**Detailed Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis**

**Operational Use Case:**
**Integrated Receiving, Sorting, and Restocking Workflow During Peak Inbound Period**

**Step 1: Task Assignment and Roles**

- **Worker 1: Receiving & Preliminary Sorting Specialist**  
  - Primary responsibilities: unload received goods, place them in staging/sorting (Region 3 Areas 1 & 2), and perform initial classification.
  - Movement span: Entry point to Areas 1 & 2, frequent shuttle between staging/sorting and source storage zones (e.g., picking up received items from near Large Shelves in Region 4), with occasional trips to Waste Area for disposal of packaging or unusable goods.

- **Worker 2: Quality Inspection & Restocking Operator**  
  - Primary responsibilities: inspect sorted goods for quality, transport inspected items to final storage (Region 1 Boxes 1–3, Region 2 Shelves 1–6, or Region 4 Large Shelves), return rejected items to Waste Area, and retrieve inspection-ready goods from Areas 1 & 2.
  - Movement span: Traverses between Areas 1 & 2 (for pickup), all storage regions (for restocking or item placement), and Waste Area (for defective/rejected items).

**Step 2: Workflow Execution and Spatial Dynamics**

- **Receiving Delivery:**  
  - Goods arrive and are offloaded either directly at Region 4 (Large Shelf 1–4) or the central corridor adjacent to Region 3 (F–K, Columns 4–17), depending on shipment nature (bulk or parcel).
  - Worker 1 retrieves inbound goods using the pallet jack if heavy (Area 5–Region 4), then delivers them to Areas 1 or 2 for sorting.

- **Sorting & Flow to Inspection:**  
  - Worker 1 sorts items in Area 1 or Area 2 depending on current workload and space, temporarily organizing by destination (e.g., shelf type, box group).
  - At the same time, Worker 2 begins inspecting items already sorted in those areas, creating high overlap and possible congestion as both may work at the same table (Area 1 or 2) or pass each other frequently at entry points (Rows G–I, Columns 5–8).

- **Inspection & Storage:**  
  - Worker 2 inspects items, classifies them as pass/fail, and immediately restocks approved goods to designated storage (Boxes 1–3, Shelves 1–6, or Large Shelves 1–4).
  - Worker 2 uses main pathway corridors (e.g., E9, E14, K4, K14) to move goods efficiently, but may encounter Worker 1 bringing in new items or removing packaging waste, requiring navigation around each other and potential brief occupation of shared waypoints (e.g., G4, F7).

- **Handling Waste and Continuous Loop:**  
  - Both workers generate and dispose of packaging and unsuitable materials at the Waste Area (Region 3, F–G 1–4), periodically converging here and increasing traffic along Row F and Column 4.
  - At high inbound peaks, restocking and sorting batches overlap continuously, with both workers accessing Area 1/2 and traversing between storage and staging zones in parallel, maximizing operational realism and workflow utility.

**Step 3: Robot Autonomy and Environmental Triggers**

- While both workers perform their duties, the robot autonomously follows a material relocation task:  
  - Task: Retrieve an item from Shelf 1 (Region 2) and deliver it to Area 1 (Region 3) for sorting or inspection.
  - Robot path: A9 → B9 → C9 → D9 → E9 → E8 → E7 → F7 → F6 → F5 → G4.
  - Environmental influences: Worker 1 may enter Area 1 from the left, crossing into G4, while Worker 2 may be exiting the same area to head toward storage zones, at times occupying or briefly blocking the area or a waypoint (e.g., F7 or G4) that the robot needs.
  - Robot response: Upon encountering an occupied waypoint or unexpected obstacle (e.g., worker body or a cart), the robot autonomously pauses or reroutes slightly around the obstruction, resuming its preplanned route once the path clears—all responses triggered strictly by its sensors and environmental state, not by human communication or commands.

**Operational Realism and Justification:**

- This scenario reflects real warehouse operations during busy periods when inbound goods must be quickly received, sorted, inspected, and restocked, and throughput is prioritized.
- Both workers assume roles with natural overlap—pre-sorting and inspection demand tight coordination, yet can be performed independently and sometimes concurrently in the same physical space due to batch job flow, high item volume, or staffing patterns.
- The route network and functional area layout force repeated shared use of staging, inspection, and transit corridors, causing inevitable cross-traffic and mutual interference that a robot must robustly navigate.
- These workflows ensure high operational validity and mirror real-world co-working scenarios found in modern logistics and fulfillment centers.

**JSON Scenario Summary:**

```json
{
  "scenario": "During peak receiving hours, Worker 1 transports newly arrived goods from the warehouse entrance or Region 4 (Large Shelves) to Area 1 or Area 2 for initial sorting, moving frequently between staging, storage, and the Waste Area for disposal tasks. Simultaneously, Worker 2 inspects sorted items in Area 1 or Area 2, restocking passable goods into assigned storage (Boxes 1–3, Shelves 1–6, or Large Shelves 1–4) and taking rejected items to the Waste Area. Both workers repeatedly occupy or cross through Areas 1 and 2, central corridors, and waste disposal points, resulting in frequent, unscripted spatial overlap. Meanwhile, an autonomous robot retrieves an item from Shelf 1 and follows a route to deliver it to Area 1 for inspection. The robot dynamically reacts to temporary obstructions or occupied waypoints caused by the workers' presence—pausing or rerouting as needed—without direct human-robot interaction, ensuring uninterrupted workflow and demonstrating realistic shared-space warehouse operations."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**Worker 1: Receiving & Preliminary Sorting Specialist**

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**  
1. **Large Shelf 1 (start) → Area 1**  
   *Picks up newly arrived goods from Large Shelf 1 (receiving area/storage for inbound shipments) and delivers them to sorting/staging Area 1.*
2. **Area 1 → Waste Area**  
   *Removes packaging or unusable materials generated during sorting in Area 1 and transports them to the Waste Area for disposal.*
3. **Waste Area → Large Shelf 1**  
   *Returns to Large Shelf 1 to begin the next cycle of receiving goods.*

**Reasoning:**  
- **Large Shelf 1 → Area 1:** Aligns with the role of transferring inbound items from receiving (bulk storage) directly to a designated sorting station for initial processing. This ensures sorted items are ready for inspection.
- **Area 1 → Waste Area:** As sorting is performed, waste (packaging/unsuitable goods) is naturally generated and needs prompt removal to maintain workspace efficiency.
- **Waste Area → Large Shelf 1:** Closing the loop enables continuous, cyclic receiving and staging activity, placing the worker back at the receiving point for new arrivals.

---

**Worker 2: Quality Inspection & Restocking Operator**

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**  
1. **Area 1 (start) → Shelf 1**  
   *Picks up pre-sorted items from Area 1 (after Worker 1 delivers them) and transports them to Shelf 1 for restocking, assuming these are frequently accessed items.*
2. **Shelf 1 → Waste Area**  
   *Removes defective or rejected items detected during restocking or inspection, moving them to the Waste Area for disposal.*
3. **Waste Area → Area 1**  
   *Returns to Area 1 to collect the next batch of items awaiting inspection and restocking.*

**Reasoning:**  
- **Area 1 → Shelf 1:** Directly fulfills the restocking responsibility, collecting newly inspected goods and replenishing primary storage areas, optimizing immediate item availability.
- **Shelf 1 → Waste Area:** Defective finds during inspection/restocking are resolved by swift removal to the Waste Area—supporting quality control and active sorting-out of non-compliant stock.
- **Waste Area → Area 1:** Completes the loop by bringing the operator back to the inspection/staging area, maintaining a steady flow between gating, quality, and repositioning tasks.

---

**How Sequences Support Operational Goals and Roles:**

- **Worker 1’s loop** supports a consistent inbound logistics flow, ensuring that goods reach the sorting zone efficiently and workspaces remain uncluttered.
- **Worker 2’s loop** upholds quality assurance and inventory integrity, bridging the gap between sorting/inspection and restocking, with continuous removal of defects.
- The loops are spatially and functionally realistic: each action feeds directly into the next, supporting parallel high-throughput receiving and stocking, keeping sorting and inspection zones clear, and promoting efficient material and waste handling.
- Movement and overlap in areas (e.g., Area 1, Waste Area) realistically reflect shared workflow, causing spatial encounters that are indirectly perceived and managed by the autonomous robot as described, but without any explicit human-robot interaction.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


**Worker 1: Receiving & Preliminary Sorting Specialist**

---

### **Step 1: Large Shelf 1 → Area 1**

- **Start coordinate:** M2 (edge of Large Shelf 1)
- **End coordinate:** G4 (Area 1)
- **Full waypoint path:**  
  **[M2, L2, K2, J2, I2, H2, G2, G3, G4]**

**Explanation:**  
- M2 is an edge waypoint for Large Shelf 1, ensuring the path legitimately starts at the warehouse boundary.
- The route moves up the left warehouse edge (column 2) through valid points to minimize crossover with central traffic zones, then cuts right at the lowest row (row G) to reach G4 (an Area 1 waypoint).
- Avoids all invalid waypoints—never enters restricted points in rows I/J/H and does not use G1 or G2 except to transition through valid region boundaries.
- This path is direct, leverages edge points to avoid congestion, and deposits goods into the most accessible entry point of Area 1.

---

### **Step 2: Area 1 → Waste Area**

- **Start coordinate:** G4 (Area 1)
- **End coordinate:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **Full waypoint path:**  
  **[G4, G3]**

**Explanation:**  
- G4 and G3 are both valid waypoints and are adjacent.  
- Most direct transition for quick waste disposal, supporting rapid clearing of sorting debris.

---

### **Step 3: Waste Area → Large Shelf 1**

- **Start coordinate:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **End coordinate:** M2 (Large Shelf 1)
- **Full waypoint path:**  
  **[G3, G2, H2, I2, J2, K2, L2, M2]**

**Explanation:**  
- This reverse path from waste back to the starting point is along the leftmost column 2, employing edge waypoints and mirroring the entry route.
- Avoids invalid waypoints in rows G, H, I, and J by sticking to the lowest valid positions.
- Efficient for returning to the receiving area without crossing through more central, busier waypoints.

---

**Worker 2: Quality Inspection & Restocking Operator**

---

### **Step 1: Area 1 → Shelf 1**

- **Start coordinate:** G4 (Area 1)
- **End coordinate:** A9 (Shelf 1, upper edge)
- **Full waypoint path:**  
  **[G4, F4, E4, D4, C4, B4, A4, A9]**

**Note:** B4 and A4 are *invalid* waypoints based on your restrictions; must revise path to avoid them. The valid Area 1 and Shelf 1 waypoints to use are:

- From G4 to E4 (valid for Area 1 and central crossing), then up through columns to the valid entry point for Shelf 1.

**Revised Full waypoint path:**  
  **[G4, F4, E4, E5, D5, C5, B5, A9]**

**But:** D5, C5, B5 are *invalid*. This present a challenge: to access shelf 1 from Area 1 without directly crossing central invalid verticals, the best path is actually:

#### **Adjusted Route (Strictly Valid Waypoints):**

- G4 (Area 1)  
- F4 (valid, but does not connect directly up without crossing invalid waypoints)
- E4 (Boxes 2, valid)  
- E3 (Boxes 2, valid)
- D9 (Boxes 3, adjacent left to Shelf 1 area, valid)
- C9 (Boxes 3, valid)
- B9 (Boxes 3, valid)
- A9 (Shelf 1, valid)

**Final chosen path:**  
  **[G4, F4, E4, E3, D9, C9, B9, A9]**

**Explanation:**  
- Exits Area 1 through a shared region at F4/E4, then uses the contiguous Boxes 2 → Boxes 3 edges (E3 to D9).
- Connects up to Shelf 1 through valid entry points via B9 and A9, avoiding all invalid points on columns 4–8 in the forbidden rows.
- Uses edge path along leftmost entry to avoid central congestion and ensures all waypoints are explicitly valid for the respective areas.

---

### **Step 2: Shelf 1 → Waste Area**

- **Start coordinate:** A9 (Shelf 1)
- **End coordinate:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **Full waypoint path:**  
  **[A9, B9, C9, D9, E3, F3, G3]**

**Explanation:**  
- Leaves Shelf 1 through B9, then down through Boxes 3 to E3 (Boxes 2), cutting across F3 to G3.
- All waypoints chosen are valid and support efficient, logical transit from upper/left storage to lower left waste disposal zone.
- Path avoids all mid-grid and right-hand invalid points, travels along the left warehouse boundary, and provides a clear, unobstructed path.

---

### **Step 3: Waste Area → Area 1**

- **Start coordinate:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **End coordinate:** G4 (Area 1)
- **Full waypoint path:**  
  **[G3, G4]**

**Explanation:**  
- Same as Worker 1’s step 2—this is the most direct route back into the task loop, with adjacent valid waypoints in shared functional regions.


---

**Summary of Route Design:**
- All movement starts/ends only at area-approved, explicitly valid waypoints.
- Edge waypoints (e.g., M2, A9, G3, B9, E3) are heavily used for access, as required.
- Every path is cross-checked against the invalid list, using detours and leftmost/uppermost paths where central traffic is blocked.
- Routes are naturally shaped by the warehouse geometry, maximizing efficiency, and always return workers to their starting areas for tight operational cycles.



========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.


==================================================


Certainly! Here is a thorough validation and correction process for each worker's cyclic task sequence and waypoint paths, as previously provided:

**Proposed Path:** [M2, L2, K2, J2, I2, H2, G2, G3, G4]

#### **Validation:**
- **Start:** M2 (Large Shelf 1) — **VALID**
- **End:** G4 (Area 1) — **VALID**
- **All Waypoints:**
  - M2, L2, K2, J2, I2, H2, G2, G3, G4
- **Invalid Waypoints List Check:**
  - **I2, H2, G2 are all invalid waypoints.** (see Row I, Row H, and Row G invalids)
- **In-area Waypoint Use:**
  - End at G4 (Area 1 waypoint), but G3 (Waste Area) is not a valid Area 1 waypoint.

#### **Errors:**
- I2, H2, G2 are explicitly listed as invalid.
- G3 is not an Area 1 waypoint, so must not be used as connective step for Area 1 access.

#### **Correction Proposal:**
- Must approach Area 1 via only valid waypoints and use only Area 1-valid waypoints to enter.
- From M2, go up left-side valid waypoints, then across F4 or enter Area 1 from below via J4 (Area 1 entry). However, I2, H2, J2 (etc.) are also invalid.
- From M2, need to move **right** to a column with valid verticals; the nearest is Column 4 (which includes J4, Area 1). L4, K4, J4 are all valid waypoints.

**Revised Path:**
- [M2, L4, K4, J4, G4]
- **But:** J4 is valid, K4 and L4 are valid.
- Now, J4 is an Area 1 waypoint. From J4, moving up to G4 (Area 1).
- Check vertical connection: J4 (Area 1), I4 (Area 1), H4 (Area 1), G4 (Area 1).
- **So full revised path:**  
  [M2, L4, K4, J4, I4, H4, G4]

**All waypoints used here are valid (none are listed as invalid), and all the J4/I4/H4/G4 entries are in the Area 1 valid list.**
- **Correction accepted!**

---

### **Step 2: Area 1 (G4) → Waste Area (G3)**
**Proposed Path:** [G4, G3]
- G4 (Area 1), G3 (Waste Area).
- Both are adjacent, both their respective area-valid waypoints.

**Validation:**
- Both waypoints are valid and permitted, and the action is moving from a sorting area directly to waste.
- **No errors. Path accepted.**

---

### **Step 3: Waste Area (G3) → Large Shelf 1 (M2)**
**Proposed Path:** [G3, G2, H2, I2, J2, K2, L2, M2]
*G2, H2, I2, J2 are all invalid list!*

#### **Validation:**
- **G2, H2, I2, J2** are all explicitly invalid as per the list.

#### **Correction Proposal:**
- From G3, cannot move left (G2, etc.) — must move right and up, using valid waypoints, to reach the bottom row (Row M) and then right to M2.
- G3 is in column 3; the first valid vertical for moving down toward Row M without crossing invalids is Column 4 (as before).

- **Possible revised path:**
  - G3 → F4 (valid) → K4 (valid) → L4 (valid) → M4 (Large Shelf 1, valid).  
  - But need to traverse along Row M from M4 to M2. L4 → M4, then M4 → M3 → M2

**Full path:** [G3, F4, K4, L4, M4, M3, M2]

- All waypoints: G3 (Waste), F4 (valid and not listed as invalid), K4, L4, M4, M3, M2 (all valid).
- M4/M3/M2 are all within Large Shelf 1's valid points.
- **All waypoints valid; correction accepted!**

## **Worker 1 Closed Loop Check:**
M2 → ... → G4 → G3 → ... → M2  
**All transitions continuous and loop is closed.**

## **Worker 2: Quality Inspection & Restocking Operator**

### **Step 1: Area 1 (G4) → Shelf 1 (A9)**
**Proposed Path:** [G4, F4, E4, E3, D9, C9, B9, A9]

#### **Validation:**
- Start: G4 (Area 1) — valid.
- End: A9 (Shelf 1) — valid.
- **E3** (Boxes 2) is valid, **D9, C9, B9, A9** are included in Boxes 3/Shelf 1 valid list.
- **E4** is Boxes 2's valid waypoint, F4 is not in an invalid list.
- Whole segment: G4 (Area 1), F4, E4 (Boxes 2), E3 (Boxes 2), D9, C9, B9, A9 (Boxes 3 and Shelf 1).
- All are valid waypoints.
- **NO invalid waypoints used. Also, end entry to Shelf 1 is via A9, which is valid.**

#### **In-area waypoint validation:**
- For Area 1: only entry/exit at G4 (used).
- For Shelf 1: only valid entry via A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12 (A9 used).

**Path accepted.**

---

### **Step 2: Shelf 1 (A9) → Waste Area (G3)**
**Proposed Path:** [A9, B9, C9, D9, E3, F3, G3]

#### **Validation:**
- All waypoints: A9, B9, C9, D9, E3 — all valid (Boxes 3), F3 (Waste Area), G3 (Waste Area).
- F3 and G3 are both Waste Area allowed points.
- A9 (Shelf 1), B9, C9, D9 (Boxes 3/Shelf 1). All transitions continuous.
- **All are valid, no invalids present.**

---

### **Step 3: Waste Area (G3) → Area 1 (G4)**
**Proposed Path:** [G3, G4]
- G3 (Waste), G4 (Area 1), both valid and adjacent.

**Path is correct and valid.**

---

## **Worker 2 Closed Loop Check:**
G4 → ... → A9 → ... → G3 → G4  
All transitions continuous, loop returns to starting point.

### **Final Revised Valid Paths for Both Workers**

#### **Worker 1:**
1. **Large Shelf 1 (M2) → Area 1 (G4):**  
   **[M2, L4, K4, J4, I4, H4, G4]**
2. **Area 1 (G4) → Waste Area (G3):**  
   **[G4, G3]**
3. **Waste Area (G3) → Large Shelf 1 (M2):**  
   **[G3, F4, K4, L4, M4, M3, M2]**

#### **Worker 2:**
1. **Area 1 (G4) → Shelf 1 (A9):**  
   **[G4, F4, E4, E3, D9, C9, B9, A9]**
2. **Shelf 1 (A9) → Waste Area (G3):**  
   **[A9, B9, C9, D9, E3, F3, G3]**
3. **Waste Area (G3) → Area 1 (G4):**  
   **[G3, G4]**

All listed paths meet continuity, area-valid, closed loop, and invalid-avoidance requirements.

You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
