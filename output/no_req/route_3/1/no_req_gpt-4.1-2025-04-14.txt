========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point A9, close to Shelf 1, and travels leftward from row A to row G, moving from column 9 to column 4, and ends around G4 in Area 1. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: A9 → B9 → C9 → D9 → E9 → E8 → E7 → F7 → F6 → F5 → G4. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material relocation task, picking up an item from Shelf 1 and delivering it to Area 1 for sorting, inspection, or further processing.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**Detailed Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis**

### Warehouse Operational Use Case: Receiving, Sorting, and Internal Material Transfer

#### Scenario Overview:
This scenario models an ongoing shift in which two human workers and one autonomous robot handle a batch of inbound goods receipt, sorting, and the movement of inventory within the warehouse. The scenario focuses on a realistic, high-activity period with overlapping responsibility and spatial congestion, particularly in Regions 2 and 3 (central shelves and sorting/inspection areas).

#### Worker and Robot Roles:

**Worker 1: Receipt and Distribution Specialist**
- **Main Tasks:**
  - Unloads new deliveries at the warehouse entrance (off-map, assumed near Large Shelf 1 in Region 4, M1-M4).
  - Uses the pallet jack (G–H, 22) for heavy inbound pallets, transferring them to Boxes 3 (Region 1) or directly to the staging areas (Areas 1–2, Region 3).
  - After drop-off at staging, performs basic visual inspection and preliminary sorting of bulk goods in Areas 1–2.
  - Occasionally moves along A–M/1–9, traversing behind the shelving area (Region 2) to reposition inventory, or to supply empty boxes to Box storage.

**Worker 2: Inspection, Replenishment, and Dispatch Coordinator**
- **Main Tasks:**
  - Receives partially pre-sorted inventory from Worker 1 in Areas 1–2, performing detailed inspection and quality control.
  - Transfers accepted items to specific shelves (Shelf 1–6, Region 2, A–E/10–21) by hand, matching items to their correct picking/stock locations.
  - Handles returns or rejects items for disposal, periodically carrying rejected items to the Waste Area (F–J/1–4, Region 3) via the central corridor.
  - Sometimes collects small items from shelves for dispatch, carrying them to Area 5 (Region 3) for final outgoing orders.

**Robot: Autonomous Internal Transporter**
- **Main Tasks:**
  - Follows the route A9 → G4, retrieving items from Shelf 1 and delivering them to Area 1 for sorting/inspection, supporting frequent movement of urgent or high-turnover SKU.
  - Navigates through main corridors, updating its route only when an environmental obstacle appears (e.g., worker or pallet blocking a waypoint).

#### Typical Workflow Sequence:
1. **Inbound Bulk Unloading & Staging:**
   - Worker 1 uses the pallet jack to move pallets from the staging entrance to Boxes 3 (Region 1, for future use) or directly to Area 1 or Area 2 (Region 3) for rapid turnaround.
   - Worker 1 may briefly block corridor waypoints (e.g., G21–G14 or F7–F5) while maneuvering or sorting items, creating potential navigation obstacles.

2. **Initial Sorting & Handover:**
   - Worker 1 unpacks some items in Area 1 while Worker 2 simultaneously prepares for inspection in Area 2. They sometimes overlap in Area 1, both handling and moving boxes.
   - Items requiring immediate restocking are distinguished and prepared for Worker 2’s next task.

3. **Inspection, Shelving, and Replenishment:**
   - Worker 2 inspects new items, then frequently moves between Area 2, Shelves 1–6 (Region 2), and sometimes Area 5 for outgoing goods. Their work regularly takes them across horizontal corridors (E/F rows) and into shelf aisles (A–E, 10–21).
   - Worker 2 occasionally occupies or stands on corridor waypoints (e.g., E10–E15), unintentionally creating temporary robot navigation blockages.

4. **Waste and Returns Management:**
   - Both workers may need intermittent access to the Waste Area, crossing main corridors (e.g., G4) at random intervals to dispose of damaged packaging or rejected goods.

5. **Concurrent Robot Tasks:**
   - The robot, meanwhile, is tasked with routine replenishment of Area 1. It leaves Shelf 1 (A9), traverses the corridor (A9 → B9 → ... → G4), and deposits items at Area 1.
   - If a waypoint is obstructed (for example, Worker 2 standing at F7 while shelving), the robot waits or dynamically reroutes, depending on the proximity.
   - The robot never anticipates or is directed by the workers; all reactions (e.g., stopping, local rerouting) are triggered only by the detected environmental presence of workers, items on the ground, or repositioned boxes.

#### Spatial Crossovers and Dynamic Congestion:
- Both Workers 1 and 2 often operate concurrently in Area 1 and Area 2.
- Worker 2 frequently walks between Areas 2 and the Shelves (Region 2), often using the same corridors the robot relies upon.
- Worker 1, when returning the pallet jack, can temporarily block access to Area 5 and the main thoroughfare.
- The Waste Area (G4) is a major junction for both robot delivery and worker disposal, increasing the probability of spatial congestion.
- Both workers use the same central corridors as the robot, and sometimes pause briefly at intersections, unintentionally triggering robot response and short delays.

#### Realism and Process Rationale:
- The sequence matches actual warehouse receipt and inspection processes, where goods enter, are short-term staged, sorted, then moved to quality control and stocked for picking.
- Role overlap and crossover naturally occur: Inbound bulk often requires both unpacking and immediate preliminary sorting by Worker 1, with Worker 2 handling more detailed inspection and restocking.
- The spatial flow aligns with the warehouse’s functional zone layout: heavy/bulk to the left and bottom, frequent-pick shelves centrally, movement corridors accessible from all zones.
- The scenario accurately models unplanned interference: neither worker intentionally blocks the robot, but the environment is dynamic and occasionally congested due to overlapping legitimate task execution.
- The robot’s navigation is fully autonomous and environmental only—reacting in real-time to the presence or absence of workers and objects, not influenced by signals or commands.

**Scenario Summary JSON:**
```json
{
  "scenario": "Two human workers and an autonomous robot operate concurrently to process inbound goods in the warehouse. Worker 1 unloads deliveries and uses the pallet jack to transfer and stage goods in Boxes 3 or Areas 1–2. Worker 2 inspects items in Areas 1–2 and shelves approved goods in Shelf 1–6, while also handling returns to the Waste Area and dispatch prepping in Area 5. Both workers move through shared corridors and frequently occupy or transition through Areas 1–2, causing transient obstructions and spatial congestion. The robot autonomously relocates items from Shelf 1 to Area 1 along the central corridor, with all navigation decisions triggered by the physical presence or absence of obstacles—adjusting only when a worker blocks its intended route. All task crossovers and shared space use result from core process requirements, creating a naturally high-interference workflow typical in active warehouse environments."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**High-Level Cyclic Task Sequences with Reasoning**

---

### Worker 1: Receipt and Distribution Specialist

#### Task Sequence:
1. **Pallet Jack (Area 5) → Boxes 3**
2. **Boxes 3 → Area 1**
3. **Area 1 → Area 2**
4. **Area 2 → Waste Area**
5. **Waste Area → Pallet Jack (Area 5)**

#### Reasoning:
- **Pallet Jack (Area 5) → Boxes 3:** Worker 1 begins at the pallet jack, essential for transporting newly received goods from unloading to bulk storage (Boxes 3).
- **Boxes 3 → Area 1:** After placing inbound items in bulk storage, some items need to be staged or sorted immediately for processing—worker moves these to Area 1.
- **Area 1 → Area 2:** Items requiring further inspection or sorting are handed over to Area 2, aligning with workflow collaboration and handoffs.
- **Area 2 → Waste Area:** Damaged or non-compliant materials found during handling in Area 2 are immediately removed to the Waste Area, continuing efficient process flow and freeing staging space.
- **Waste Area → Pallet Jack (Area 5):** After disposal, Worker 1 returns to the Pallet Jack, ready for the next cycle of unloading or moving goods, forming a complete operational loop.

---

### Worker 2: Inspection, Replenishment, and Dispatch Coordinator

#### Task Sequence:
1. **Area 2 → Shelf 1–6**
2. **Shelf 1–6 → Area 5**
3. **Area 5 → Waste Area**
4. **Waste Area → Area 1**
5. **Area 1 → Area 2**

#### Reasoning:
- **Area 2 → Shelf 1–6:** Worker 2 starts with inspected goods in Area 2 and replenishes shelves (Shelf 1–6) as needed, supporting stock levels and flow of materials.
- **Shelf 1–6 → Area 5:** When picking is required for dispatch or specific orders, Worker 2 collects items from the shelves and brings them to Area 5 for outgoing preparation.
- **Area 5 → Waste Area:** Packing or inspection in Area 5 may generate refuse or unveil further rejected items—worker disposes of waste in the Waste Area.
- **Waste Area → Area 1:** Worker returns via Area 1, where new incoming or staged items may require additional inspection, creating a continuous feedback loop in the sorting process.
- **Area 1 → Area 2:** Finally, the worker returns to Area 2, ready to repeat the inspection and restocking tasks, ensuring workflow continuity.

---

**Summary:**  
Each sequence is cyclic and operationally grounded:
- **Worker 1** focuses on movement of bulk and inbound goods, initial staging, and waste handling, forming a loop integral to sustained material flow.
- **Worker 2** is dedicated to quality control, shelf replenishment, picking for dispatch, and supporting overall workflow through continual circulation among inspection, storage, and waste processes.
- The order of zones ensures efficient workflow, prevents backtracking, and naturally integrates both workers’ activities into the core warehouse operation, maximizing throughput while minimizing idle time and cross-traffic disruptions.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


---

## Worker 1: Receipt and Distribution Specialist – Waypoint-Based Movement Paths

### Task 1: Pallet Jack (Area 5) → Boxes 3
- **Start:** G21 (Area Valid Waypoint for Pallet Jack)
- **End:** E7 (Area Valid Waypoint for Boxes 3)
- **Full Path:** [G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, F7, E7]
- **Explanation:** 
  - G21 is at the edge and valid for Pallet Jack; E7 is valid for Boxes 3.
  - This path traces the main horizontal corridor (G-row), maximizes open movement space to avoid vertical congestion, and then cuts up at F7 to E7 (a Boxes 3 entry point).
  - Edge point G21 is used as a logical starting location (Pallet Jack parking), and E7 lies at the edge of the Boxes 3 cluster for direct access. The path avoids all specified invalid waypoints.

---

### Task 2: Boxes 3 → Area 1
- **Start:** E7 (Boxes 3)
- **End:** G4 (Area 1)
- **Full Path:** [E7, F7, G7, G6, G5, G4]
- **Explanation:**
  - E7 and G4 are both area-valid waypoints and located at the edges of their respective clusters.
  - The route moves down via the main aisle (F7) and quickly into G-row, passing close to but not using any invalid points. The path sticks to edge-aligned approaches for optimal drop-off and pickup efficiency.

---

### Task 3: Area 1 → Area 2
- **Start:** G4 (Area 1)
- **End:** G7 (Area 2)
- **Full Path:** [G4, G5, G6, G7]
- **Explanation:**
  - Both waypoints are valid edges for each area.
  - Using consecutive G-row waypoints avoids entering denser central or invalid points while keeping the route short and direct.

---

### Task 4: Area 2 → Waste Area
- **Start:** G7 (Area 2)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **Full Path:** [G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]
- **Explanation:**
  - G3 is a direct, valid entry for Waste Area and easily reached moving left along the G-row, sticking to the periphery and completely avoiding all invalid points.

---

### Task 5: Waste Area → Pallet Jack (Area 5)
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **End:** G21 (Pallet Jack)
- **Full Path:** [G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21]
- **Explanation:**
  - Full horizontal traverse across the G-row, leveraging corridor efficiency with no vertical movement necessary.
  - Both G3 and G21 are edge points. This path bypasses invalid waypoints by never leaving the G-row.

---

## Worker 2: Inspection, Replenishment, and Dispatch Coordinator – Waypoint-Based Movement Paths

### Task 1: Area 2 → Shelf 1–6
- **Start:** G7 (Area 2)
- **End:** (Example: A12, Shelf 2)
- **Full Path:** [G7, F7, E7, E8, E9, D9, C9, B9, A9, A12]
- **Explanation:**
  - Moves up from Area 2 to the top aisle, using F7 to E7 (connecting corridor) and then across the upper warehouse corridor (E, D, C, B, A) toward the shelf area.
  - Selects edge point A12, a valid pick station at the boundary of Shelf 2, demonstrating appropriate edge waypoint use. Avoids all invalid waypoints.

---

### Task 2: Shelf 1–6 → Area 5
- **Start:** A12 (Shelf 2)
- **End:** G18 (Area 5)
- **Full Path:** [A12, B12, C12, D12, E12, F12, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18]
- **Explanation:**
  - Uses A12 as the edge start, moves steadily downward through the shelf corridor, then directly west along valid G-row points to the edge Area 5 entry.
  - This route is efficient, avoids invalids (A13, B13, C13, etc.), and remains mostly along vertical/horizontal corridors for quick access.

---

### Task 3: Area 5 → Waste Area
- **Start:** G18 (Area 5)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **Full Path:** [G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]
- **Explanation:**
  - Follows the main corridor along G-row, tracing edge-to-edge and using only valid area entries.
  - This keeps the worker on broad, open paths, maintaining efficiency and visibility for both human and robot.

---

### Task 4: Waste Area → Area 1
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area)
- **End:** G4 (Area 1)
- **Full Path:** [G3, G4]
- **Explanation:**
  - G4 is immediately adjacent to G3; both are valid edge points that minimize movement.
  - This ultra-short run increases cycle frequency and efficiency, aligning with the possible need for frequent staging or touch-ups in the sorting area.

---

### Task 5: Area 1 → Area 2
- **Start:** G4 (Area 1)
- **End:** G7 (Area 2)
- **Full Path:** [G4, G5, G6, G7]
- **Explanation:**
  - Same efficient edge-aligned movement as Worker 1.
  - Optimizes transition between sorting and inspection phases for Worker 2’s role.

---

### Additional Notes
- **Edge Waypoints:** Used wherever logical (e.g., G21, A12, G4, G3). This not only meets operational requirements but maximizes space, avoids congestion, and supports continuous flow.
- **Invalid Waypoints:** All routes explicitly check and avoid every listed invalid coordinate.
- **Route Efficiency:** Each path forms a single, efficient, easily repeatable loop, reduces backtracking, and supports both rapid throughput and safety in the shared environment, where robot movements may be dynamically affected by these human paths.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9

- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21

For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.


==================================================


Absolutely! Below is a thorough validation and revision for each worker’s previously generated waypoint paths, broken down by segment. Each segment is checked step by step against the requirements, all errors are noted, and corrected paths are proposed where needed.

You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
