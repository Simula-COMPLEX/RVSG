  "scenario": "Two human workers and an autonomous robot operate concurrently to process inbound goods in the warehouse. Worker 1 unloads deliveries and uses the pallet jack to transfer and stage goods in Boxes 3 or Areas 1–2. Worker 2 inspects items in Areas 1–2 and shelves approved goods in Shelf 1–6, while also handling returns to the Waste Area and dispatch prepping in Area 5. Both workers move through shared corridors and frequently occupy or transition through Areas 1–2, causing transient obstructions and spatial congestion. The robot autonomously relocates items from Shelf 1 to Area 1 along the central corridor, with all navigation decisions triggered by the physical presence or absence of obstacles—adjusting only when a worker blocks its intended route. All task crossovers and shared space use result from core process requirements, creating a naturally high-interference workflow typical in active warehouse environments.",
