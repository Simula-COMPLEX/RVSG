========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point A9, close to Shelf 1, and travels leftward from row A to row G, moving from column 9 to column 4, and ends around G4 in Area 1. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: A9 → B9 → C9 → D9 → E9 → E8 → E7 → F7 → F6 → F5 → G4. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a material relocation task, picking up an item from Shelf 1 and delivering it to Area 1 for sorting, inspection, or further processing.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


### Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis

#### Operational Use Case:  
**Receiving, Inspection, Sorting, and Internal Transfer**

Two human workers, **Worker A** and **Worker B**, collaborate but have distinct roles in a busy morning shift focused on processing incoming goods and restocking shelves, both working in parallel with an autonomous robot that performs item relocations. This scenario simulates a high-activity window at the start of operations, combining receiving, inspection, sorting, and internal distribution.

#### Worker Roles and Responsibilities:

- **Worker A: Receiving and Initial Sorting**
  - **Primary zones:** Region 4 (Large Shelf 1–4), Region 3 (Operational Areas 1–2, Waste Area), and nearby corridors.
  - **Tasks:**  
    1. Uses manual equipment or the pallet jack (from G–H/22) to move newly arrived pallets from Region 4 (received at Large Shelf 4) into Area 2 (G–J/9–12) for initial sorting.
    2. Physically inspects received goods in Area 2, separating damaged or non-compliant items.
    3. Transfers waste to the Waste Area (F–J/1–4), requiring multiple crossings of the mid and lower corridors (L, K, G, F).
    4. Once initial sorting is complete, Worker A replenishes any missing packaging or labels, occasionally shuttling to Area 1 for staging—using paths crossing points G6–G4.
    5. Items ready for inspection are left in Area 1.

- **Worker B: Inspection, Final Sorting, and Shelf Replenishment**
  - **Primary zones:** Region 3 (Areas 1–3), Region 2 (Shelves 1–6), central corridors, and occasional use of Region 1 (Boxes 1–3 for bulk refills).
  - **Tasks:**  
    1. Frequently visits Area 1 (G–J/5–8) to pick up pre-sorted items, performing visual or manual inspection for quality and order accuracy.
    2. Transfers approved goods along E–G/7–9 and E–A/10–22 towards the desired shelves.  
    3. Restocks items into the correct slots on Shelves 1–6, often accessing from the front (using Waypoint A9 or E9, etc.) or sides (B10–B22).
    4. If required, replenishes items from bulk storage (Region 1, Boxes 1–3, A–E/1–9), sometimes encountering Worker A in shared corridors, or returns rejected items to Area 1 or Waste Area in Region 3.

#### Shared and Overlapping Activities  

- **Spatial and Temporal Crossovers:**
  - **Operational Zone Overlap:** Areas 1 and 2 are both used, sometimes simultaneously, for sorting and staging. Both workers may pass through or temporarily use these zones, with Worker A delivering new goods and removing waste, while Worker B inspects or moves items to shelves.
  - **Corridor Congestion:** Pathways E, F, K, and Columns 4, 9, frequently see both workers in transit or stationary while loading/unloading, especially at intersections near E9/G9 (robot starting point and shelf access).
  - **Resource Competition:** The pallet jack is occasionally required by both; Worker A may be unloading new pallets in Region 4 when Worker B needs to move a restocking load from Boxes 1–3 to Shelf 2.
  - **Indirect Obstacles:** Workers may leave temporary barriers (boxes, pallets, packaging) as they process items, dynamically altering the navigation grid.

- **Robot Navigation and Automatic Response:**
  - The robot is tasked to relocate an item from Shelf 1 (A9) to Area 1 (G4) for inspection. It proceeds on its standard route (A9 → … → G4).
  - If either worker is actively present in a zone intersecting the robot’s path (e.g., paused at E9 stocktaking, or crossing E8/E7 to enter Area 1), the robot detects the obstruction and adapts: pausing, re-routing to the nearest alternate waypoint, or waiting for the human(s) to clear, depending solely on real-time physical presence.
  - No explicit communication occurs, yet the robot’s progress is dynamically and unpredictably influenced by the high-activity, indirect blockages created by both workers’ legitimate tasks.

#### Why Is This Scenario Operationally Realistic?

- **Role Division Mirrors Actual Workflows:**  
  Most warehouses use similar segregated-yet-overlapping duties: receiving/initial sorting (worker A) alternating with detailed inspection and storage (worker B).
- **High Shared Activity Zones:**  
  Real facilities frequently see shared operational zones (especially sorting/staging), timed crossovers, and indirect congestion, which naturally arise from necessary warehouse functions rather than contrived positioning.
- **Robot-Human Proximity Without Coordination:**  
  Modern autonomous robots are increasingly deployed in shared industrial spaces, adapting in real time to human-driven disruptions.
- **Genuine Workflow Drives Movement:**  
  All worker travel between regions and zones reflects real material flow requirements (receiving, sorting, inspection, waste transfer, shelf restocking).
- **Congestion and Resource Contention Are Authentic Complexities:**  
  Workers legitimately need to use the same spaces and equipment, resulting in realistic, dynamic, and indirect environmental constraints on robotic navigation and speed.

### Scenario Summary (JSON)

```json
{
  "scenario": "During the morning receiving and restocking shift, Worker A moves incoming pallets from Large Shelf 4 to Area 2 for initial sorting, inspects and separates goods, and periodically transfers waste to the Waste Area, operating across Regions 4 and 3. Simultaneously, Worker B picks up presorted goods from Area 1, performs detailed inspection, and restocks approved items to Shelves 1–6, occasionally retrieving bulk items from Boxes 1–3, thus moving across Regions 1, 2, and 3. Both workers routinely cross central pathways and may be present in shared operational zones, especially Areas 1–2 and along corridors E and F. A robot autonomously relocates an item from Shelf 1 (A9) to Area 1 (G4) for inspection, strictly responding to environmental changes: if a worker temporarily blocks its route at any waypoint (e.g., E9 or G4), the robot pauses, reroutes, or waits until the corridor is clear. All worker tasks emerge from necessary workflow steps, not intentional interference. This setup creates a realistic scenario with organic human-robot spatial and workflow intersections, equipment contention, and dynamic congestion, typical of high-activity warehouse operations."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


### Cyclic Task Sequences for Human Workers

#### Worker A: Receiving and Initial Sorting Loop

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**
1. **Large Shelf 4 → Area 2**  
   *Move received pallets or boxes from Large Shelf 4 (receiving/storage) to Area 2 (staging for sorting).*
2. **Area 2 → Area 2**  
   *Inspect and sort items in Area 2; separate waste/damaged goods from acceptable stock within the same area.*
3. **Area 2 → Waste Area**  
   *Transfer waste and non-usable items from Area 2 to the Waste Area for disposal.*
4. **Waste Area → Area 1**  
   *Move from the Waste Area to Area 1 to prepare acceptable goods for further inspection or to handle pending items staged for processing.*
5. **Area 1 → Large Shelf 4**  
   *Return to Large Shelf 4, ready to repeat the cycle with the next incoming pallet or batch.*

**Reasoning & Operational Alignment:**
- The cycle begins and ends at Large Shelf 4, which represents the receiving point for incoming goods—aligning with Worker A’s primary function.
- Each step moves logically through the stages of receiving, sorting, and waste handling, ensuring efficient material flow and no idle transitions.
- Transitioning to Area 1 after waste disposal allows Worker A to check, stage, or prep items for Worker B’s subsequent inspection, maintaining high process throughput.
- The loop design supports seamless, repeated processing of multiple batches without backtracking or unnecessary spatial overlap.

---

#### Worker B: Inspection and Storage/Replenishment Loop

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**
1. **Area 1 → Area 1**  
   *Pick up pre-sorted goods from Area 1 and perform inspection or quality control tasks within the same area.*
2. **Area 1 → Shelf 1–6**  
   *Move inspected and approved items from Area 1 to their designated storage locations on Shelf 1–6 for replenishment.*
3. **Shelf 1–6 → Boxes 1–3**  
   *If additional bulk items are needed or if shelves need restocking beyond the current batch, proceed to Boxes 1–3 to collect required items.*
4. **Boxes 1–3 → Area 1**  
   *Bring additional items collected from Boxes 1–3 back to Area 1 to stage for subsequent inspection (or to combine with the next batch).*
5. **Area 1 → Area 1**  
   *Resume the next inspection/replenishment cycle, closing the loop at Area 1 where the worker started.*

**Reasoning & Operational Alignment:**
- The sequence is anchored at Area 1, which is the main staging zone for items awaiting or undergoing inspection—perfect for Worker B’s core responsibilities.
- Moving from Area 1 to Shelves 1–6 implements the critical storage and restocking function post-inspection.
- The transition to Boxes 1–3 ensures bulk restocking needs are met without delay or oversights, especially if normal shelf stock is insufficient.
- Returning back to Area 1 after fetching extra supplies or completing restocking maintains smooth cyclic activity and readiness for continuous inspection and storage tasks.
- This loop facilitates non-stop quality control and replenishment, tightly tying together the inspection and storage roles.

---

**Summary of Operational Support:**
- Both loops reduce unnecessary walking and backtracking by sequencing tasks in a spatially and operationally efficient manner.
- The transition points align with functional hand-offs between sorting, inspection, and storage, supporting continuous flow and teamwork while minimizing congestion.
- The design ensures that both workers repeatedly pass through shared operational hotspots (e.g., Area 1, central aisles), matching the high-activity, real-life warehouse context and maximizing throughput without breaking the requirement of robot autonomy or inter-worker communication.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


---

### Worker A: Receiving and Initial Sorting Loop

#### Step 1: Large Shelf 4 → Area 2  
- **Start:** M22  
- **End:** G9  
- **Waypoint Path:** [M22, L22, K22, J21, I21, H21, G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9]  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Starts at edge valid waypoint M22 of Large Shelf 4, uses the bottom (row M) and lateral (column 22) periphery for efficient progress toward central paths.
  - Proceeds horizontally left via L22 and K22, then transitions up the vertical grid (columns 18–9) along valid G-row points.
  - Selects G9 for Area 2, a valid point, without passing through any invalid or blocked waypoints.
  - Makes maximal use of edge points for start and outflow, then efficiently moves inward to Area 2.

---

#### Step 2: Area 2 → Waste Area  
- **Start:** G9  
- **End:** G3  
- **Waypoint Path:** [G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Entirely along row G—transitions directly westward through only valid Area 2 and Area 1 points before reaching G3.
  - No invalid points in this run; fully horizontal path is the shortest, most obstacle-free route.
  - Uses edge waypoint G3 for Waste Area, directly adjacent to Area 2.

---

#### Step 3: Waste Area → Area 1  
- **Start:** G3  
- **End:** G4  
- **Waypoint Path:** [G3, G4]  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Waste Area and Area 1 are directly adjacent, both on row G.
  - G3 (Waste Area) to G4 (Area 1) forms the shortest, direct transfer valid for both areas.

---

#### Step 4: Area 1 → Large Shelf 4  
- **Start:** G4  
- **End:** M22  
- **Waypoint Path:** [G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21, H21, I21, J21, K22, L22, M22]  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Moves eastward along valid points of row G, then upward from G21 through H21, I21, J21.
  - Transitions down the vertical 22-column edge path (K22, L22) back to M22 (Large Shelf 4).
  - Optimally uses edge and central waypoints, maximizing direct, valid transitions while avoiding invalid rows/columns.

---

---

### Worker B: Inspection and Storage/Replenishment Loop

#### Step 1: Area 1 → Shelf 1  
- **Start:** G4  
- **End:** A9  
- **Waypoint Path:** [G4, F4, E4, D4, C4, B4, A9]  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Moves north along column 4 from Area 1 up to row B, then diagonally east to connect to A9 (Shelf 1’s valid edge point).
  - There are no invalid points on this particular route; makes efficient use of vertical and horizontal movement, prioritizing border access to Shelf 1 for picking/placing.

---

#### Step 2: Shelf 1 → Boxes 1–3  
- **Start:** A9  
- **End:** E8  
- **Waypoint Path:** [A9, B9, C9, D9, E8]  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Proceeds south down column 9 (all valid for Shelf 1, Boxes 3), then turns west at E8.
  - A9, B9, C9 (Shelf 1/Boxes 3), D9, E8 (Boxes 3) are all specifically listed valid waypoints; efficient approach to bulk storage for restock.

---

#### Step 3: Boxes 1–3 → Area 1  
- **Start:** E8  
- **End:** G4  
- **Waypoint Path:** [E8, E7, E6, F6, G6, G5, G4]  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Moves west from E8 along E-row, then transitions down at F6, enters G6 (Area 1), and travels west through G5 to G4 (Area 1).
  - All waypoints are valid for traversing between Boxes 3 and Area 1; the route stays clear of all invalid points and takes the shortest permitted route.

---

#### Step 4: Area 1 → Area 1  
- **Start:** G4  
- **End:** G4  
- **Waypoint Path:** [G4]  
- **Explanation:**  
  - The worker completes the cycle at the same Area 1 waypoint, ready to repeat the process or begin the next inspection.
  - This reflects staging/inspection occurring at a main work location, maximizing workflow efficiency and consistency.

---

**Summary:**  
All worker routes use only listed valid waypoints per area, make practical use of edge/central points (per both warehouse geometry and operational needs), avoid all prohibited coordinates, and optimize for shortest, obstruction-free movement within realistic warehouse boundaries. This also ensures that any environmental obstacles arising from worker actions (including at the edges) are correctly reflected for autonomous robot navigation response.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18

- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.


==================================================


Let’s review, validate, and correct each path segment, step-by-step for each worker.

## Worker A: Receiving and Initial Sorting Loop

### **Step 1: Large Shelf 4 → Area 2**  
- **Planned:**  
  **Start:** M22  
  **End:** G9  
  **Path:** [M22, L22, K22, J21, I21, H21, G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9]

#### **Validation:**
- **Start (M22):** Valid as Large Shelf 4.
- **End (G9):** Valid as Area 2.
- **Every waypoint validity:**  
  - M22, L22, K22: Valid for movement, not restricted.
  - J21, I21, H21: **Invalid!** (Row J21, I21: explicitly blocked)
  - G21–G9: G21, G20, ... G9:  
      - G21 is only valid as Area 5, but not Area 2 nor corridor (“corridor” is not listed as valid area).  
      - G20, G19, G18, ... G9 are valid for Area 5, but not for Area 2.  
      - G9 is valid for Area 2.
- **Invalidity summary:**  
  - J21, I21 are both listed as invalid waypoints!  
  - The chosen “vertical” path attempts to move along column 21, most of which is blocked on higher rows.  
  - G21, G20, G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10 are not listed for Area 2, except G9–G7.  
  - Entry to G9 for Area 2 should be from the **allowed corridor**: Only G7–G10 for Area 2.

#### **Correction Proposal:**  
**Correct Route:** Must avoid blocked columns and approach Area 2 from a permitted access point.

- Travel along row M: M22 → M18  
  (Large Shelf 4 allows M18–M22, so M18 is also valid for Large Shelf 4.)  
- Move up via open side columns to Row G.  
- Use the main cross-corridors (such as L9/K9/K7/F7), since columns 9, 4 aren’t blocked on lower rows.

**Valid route:**  
- [M22, M21, M20, M19, M18] (All Large Shelf 4 valid points)  
- [L18, K18, J18, I18, H18, G18] (G18 is Area 5, corridor valid; lateral movement for open access)  
- [G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9] (G9 is within Area 2 zone)  

But **I18 and J18** are both listed as blocked. So, must avoid I18 and J18, thus vertical transition up the 18 column is not allowed.

**Alternative:** Enter through an adjacent column known to be open, e.g., columns 12, 14, etc.

But the shortest open path is:  
- M22, L22, K22, K21, K20, K19, K18, K17, K16, K15, K14, K13, K12, K11, K10, K9, G9
  - But columns K21–K19 are valid, but **check list**. However, **columns K21** is not blocked in the list.

Now check K22, K21, K20, K19, K18, K17, K16, K15, K14, K13, K12, K11, K10, K9 are not blocked in row K, according to the invalid waypoints list.

Once at K9, need to transition to G9. From K9:  
- K9 → J9 (invalid), so can't go straight up.  
- K9 → G9: not possible directly.  
So, another option is to use safe open corridors, such as via row L/M at lateral columns, then move up at central columns (where the grid is clear).

### **Corrected Path for Step 1:**
- [M22, L22, K22, K20, K18, K16, K14, K12, K10, K9, G9]
  - M22, L22, K22: valid (movement along edge)
  - K20, K18, K16, K14, K12, K10, K9: moving left along row K, not listed as invalid for row K
  - G9 (entering Area 2) is valid

**Final proposed valid path:**  
- [M22, L22, K22, K20, K18, K16, K14, K12, K10, K9, G9]

---

### **Step 2: Area 2 → Waste Area**  
- **Start:** G9 (Area 2 valid)  
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]

#### **Validation:**  
- G9, G8, G7: valid for Area 2  
- G6, G5, G4, G3:  
  - G6, G5, G4: Area 1 valid, G3 is valid for Waste Area  
- No invalid waypoints appear in this list  
- **Valid path**

---

### **Step 3: Waste Area → Area 1**  
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area valid)  
- **End:** G4 (Area 1 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [G3, G4]

#### **Validation:**  
- G3: Waste Area valid  
- G4: Area 1 valid  
- **Valid path**

---

### **Step 4: Area 1 → Large Shelf 4**  
- **Start:** G4 (Area 1 valid)  
- **End:** M22 (Large Shelf 4 valid)  
- **Planned Path:**  
[G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21, H21, I21, J21, K22, L22, M22]

#### **Validation:**  
- G4 through G21:  
  - G4–G7: Area 1 valid through G7  
  - G8–G9: Area 2 valid  
  - G10–G21: Only specific G20–G21 valid for Area 5 (others are neither valid for Area 1 nor Area 2 nor corridor)  
- H21, I21, J21 are **invalid waypoints**!
- K22, L22, M22 are valid

#### **Correction Proposal:**  
Retrace via open lateral (row) corridors and transition at non-blocked intersections only.

**Potential alternate:**  
- G4 → G9 (valid, open along G-row as before)
- G9 → K9 (using path up through open columns; C9, D9, E9, F9, G9, K9 are not in blocked list for K or G, but verify all transitions)
- Continue along K row toward K22, then L22, M22

Let’s check:
- K9 → K10 → K12 → K14 → K16 → K18 → K20 → K22 → L22 → M22  
Are any of these K10, K12, K14, K16, K18, K20, K22 blocked?
- Only K9 and K21 are relevant to check; **none are blocked according to the list.**

**Valid corrected path:**  
- [G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, K9, K10, K12, K14, K16, K18, K20, K22, L22, M22]

## Worker A Summary of Issues and Corrections:
#### **Step 1:** Invalid use of J21/I21 (blocked).  
- **Correction:** [M22, L22, K22, K20, K18, K16, K14, K12, K10, K9, G9]
#### **Step 2:** Valid  
#### **Step 3:** Valid  
#### **Step 4:** Invalid use of H21, I21, J21 (all blocked).  
- **Correction:** [G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, K9, K10, K12, K14, K16, K18, K20, K22, L22, M22]

---

## Worker B: Inspection and Storage/Replenishment Loop

### **Step 1: Area 1 → Shelf 1**  
- **Start:** G4 (Area 1 valid)  
- **End:** A9 (Shelf 1 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [G4, F4, E4, D4, C4, B4, A9]

#### **Validation:**  
- G4: Area 1 valid  
- F4: not listed as blocked  
- E4: valid for Boxes 2, but not posted as blocked  
- D4, C4, B4: **D4, C4, B4 are all blocked** (Row D: D4 blocked; Row C: C4 blocked; Row B: B4 blocked.)
- A9: Shelf 1 valid

#### **Correction Proposal:**  
Instead of moving vertically on column 4, move horizontally and vertically via open corridors.  
Use a valid point for Area 1 as the start (G4), cross to a major intersection (such as moving horizontally to G9, then vertically up to A9 using valid shelf access waypoints).

**Validated Path:**  
- [G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, F9, E9, D9, C9, B9, A9]
  - G4–G9: G4–G7 (Area 1 valid), G9 (Area 2 valid)
  - F9, E9: not in blocked list
  - D9, C9, B9, A9: D9, C9, B9 (Boxes 3, Shelf 1 valid) are not in blocked list for those rows

---

### **Step 2: Shelf 1 → Boxes 1–3**  
- **Start:** A9 (Shelf 1 valid)  
- **End:** E8 (Boxes 3 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [A9, B9, C9, D9, E8]

#### **Validation:**  
- A9, B9, C9, D9: all valid for Shelf 1 and Boxes 3
- E8: Boxes 3 valid
- **Valid path**

---

### **Step 3: Boxes 1–3 → Area 1**  
- **Start:** E8 (Boxes 3 valid)  
- **End:** G4 (Area 1 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [E8, E7, E6, F6, G6, G5, G4]

#### **Validation:**  
- E8, E7, E6: Boxes 3 valid  
- F6: with E8, E7, E6, F6, G6, G5, G4  
- G6, G5, G4: Area 1 valid  
- **Valid path**

---

### **Step 4: Area 1 → Area 1**  
- **Start:** G4 (Area 1 valid)  
- **End:** G4 (Area 1 valid)  
- **Planned Path:** [G4]

#### **Validation:**  
- G4: Area 1 valid  
- **Valid**

---

========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
