  "scenario": "During the morning receiving and restocking shift, Worker A moves incoming pallets from Large Shelf 4 to Area 2 for initial sorting, inspects and separates goods, and periodically transfers waste to the Waste Area, operating across Regions 4 and 3. Simultaneously, Worker B picks up presorted goods from Area 1, performs detailed inspection, and restocks approved items to Shelves 1–6, occasionally retrieving bulk items from Boxes 1–3, thus moving across Regions 1, 2, and 3. Both workers routinely cross central pathways and may be present in shared operational zones, especially Areas 1–2 and along corridors E and F. A robot autonomously relocates an item from Shelf 1 (A9) to Area 1 (G4) for inspection, strictly responding to environmental changes: if a worker temporarily blocks its route at any waypoint (e.g., E9 or G4), the robot pauses, reroutes, or waits until the corridor is clear. All worker tasks emerge from necessary workflow steps, not intentional interference. This setup creates a realistic scenario with organic human-robot spatial and workflow intersections, equipment contention, and dynamic congestion, typical of high-activity warehouse operations.",
