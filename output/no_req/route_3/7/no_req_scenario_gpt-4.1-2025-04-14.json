  "scenario": "A busy warehouse shift is underway as new goods arrive at Area 5. Worker A receives and inspects inbound items, shuttling them from Area 5 to the sorting and inspection zones in Areas 1 and 2 and discarding rejects in the Waste Area. Worker B retrieves inspected items from Area 1, repeatedly moving them to Shelf 1 for high-priority stock or to the large bottom shelves for bulk storage, sometimes using Area 3 as overflow when routes are blocked. Meanwhile, an autonomous robot collects stock from Shelf 1 and delivers it to Area 1 for further sorting, navigating independently but dynamically rerouting or pausing when it encounters humans working or staging items in its planned path. Throughout, all activities proceed without direct communication between humans and the robot, but the robot’s movements adapt in real time to the congestion and obstacles created by the workers’ ongoing tasks.",
