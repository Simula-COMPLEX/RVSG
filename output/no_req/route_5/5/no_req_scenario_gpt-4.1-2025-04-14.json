  "scenario": "A shipment of mixed goods arrives at the warehouse, where Worker 1 is responsible for receiving incoming pallets at Area 5, performing initial inspection, and segregating items into usable stock and waste. Usable items are moved to Areas 1 and 2 for further sorting, while defective items are set aside for disposal. Worker 2 collects sorted goods from Areas 1 and 2 for detailed inspection and distributes them to the appropriate shelves in Region 2 or large shelves in Region 4, simultaneously monitoring the Waste Area and occasionally transporting excess waste. The autonomous robot, detecting new waste in Area 5, navigates from G19 to G3 (Waste Area), carrying disposed items, and reacts solely to environmental obstacles, such as workers who may temporarily block its path while performing overlapping sorting and transfer activities. Both workers regularly traverse shared corridors and work simultaneously in adjacent and common zones, creating realistic congestion and mutual interference, especially along the central grid and operational areas of Region 3.",
