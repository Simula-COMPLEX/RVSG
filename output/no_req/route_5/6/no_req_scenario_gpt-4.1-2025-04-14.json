  "scenario": "During peak receiving and dispatch hours, Worker 1 handles receiving, inspection, and sorting of new stock at Area 1, transporting sorted items across multiple warehouse zones (Regions 1, 2, and 4) for storage via central corridors along Rows E, F, and K. Simultaneously, Worker 2 manages waste removal and dispatch preparation in Area 5, shuttling waste to the Waste Area and preparing items for outbound shipment, frequently moving along Row G and using the pallet jack. Both workers alternate between operational zones, leading to natural overlap and movement congestion in Region 3, especially on Row G. The autonomous robot independently collects a waste container from Area 5, navigating leftward along Row G toward the Waste Area. The robot's path is periodically obstructed by human activity (item movement or pallet jack use), causing the robot to stop or reroute, but never directly interacting with the workers. The scenario captures a realistic high-traffic operational period with naturally overlapping workflows and indirect robot-human spatial interference.",
