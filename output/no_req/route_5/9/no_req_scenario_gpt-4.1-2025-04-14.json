  "scenario": "At the end of the shift, Worker 1 is assigned to disposal and waste management, collecting discarded materials from Areas 1–5 and transporting them to the Waste Area by regularly traversing the main horizontal corridor (Row G), particularly between Area 5 (G19) and the Waste Area (G3). Worker 2 is the inspection and restocking specialist, moving between Areas 3–4 to inspect staged items and returning accepted goods to Large Shelves in Region 4 via the same corridor, often using carts or pallets. Both workers frequently occupy Area 5 and the connecting pathway, sometimes simultaneously or in alternating cycles. Meanwhile, the robot autonomously follows its programmed route from Area 5 (G19) to the Waste Area (G3), responding dynamically to new obstacles when either worker or their equipment temporarily blocks points along the path, such as G16, G12, or G8. The robot’s route adjustments, stops, or delays are triggered solely by these environmental changes, accurately reflecting the operational complexity of shared human-robot workflows in constrained warehouse environments.",
