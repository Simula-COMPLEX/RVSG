  "scenario": "Two human workers are performing concurrent warehouse tasks involving sorting, disposal, and replenishment of goods across multiple shared and operational areas. Worker 1 repeatedly sorts incoming goods in Area 1, segregates waste, and physically delivers unusable items to the Waste Area, also transferring usable stock to storage zones. Worker 2 retrieves and replenishes sorted stock from Area 2 to Shelves in Region 2, occasionally placing overflow or ambiguous items in Area 5 or helping with bulky waste. Both workers frequently move along the central corridor (G row), sometimes blocking zones such as Area 5 and the Waste Area. An autonomous robot independently collects a waste item from Area 5 (G19) and travels left on G row to deposit it in the Waste Area (G3). Throughout the workflow, the robot may stop, slow, or reroute solely in response to detecting physical obstacles caused by human workers’ ongoing standard operations, especially when they temporarily occupy or block key corridor waypoints. There is no direct communication between human workers and the robot; all robot reactions stem exclusively from environmental changes in the shared warehouse space.",
