========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point G19 in Area 5, and travels leftward along row G, moving from column 19 to column 3, and ends around G3 in Waste Area. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: G19 → G18 → G17 → G16 → G15 → G14 → G13 → G12 → G11 → G10 → G9 → G8 → G7 → G6 → G5 → G4 → G3. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a disposal task, picking up an item from Area 5 and delivering it to the Waste Area for discarding or recycling.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis**

**Operational Use Case Overview:**  
This scenario simulates a high-activity mid-morning warehouse workflow involving simultaneous bulk sorting and waste removal after a large inbound receipt. The tasks include inventory sorting/inspection and waste disposal, requiring both human workers to frequently navigate shared corridors and operational zones, resulting in complex, yet realistic overlap and mutual interference with an autonomous waste-disposal robot.

---

### **Workflow and Roles**  

#### **Worker 1: Inventory Sorter/Inspector**
- **Primary role:** Sort incoming inventory from bulk storage, inspect for damage or discrepancies, and stage items for putaway or return.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Retrieves boxes from **Boxes 1** and **Boxes 2** (Region 1, A–E, Columns 1–6) one at a time.
  - Transports each box via the **main pathway (E)** to the relevant operational zone in **Region 3** (Area 1 or Area 2, F–H, Columns 5–12).
  - Opens, inspects, and re-sorts items into categories (e.g., keep, re-shelve, or discard).
  - Separates damaged or non-compliant items, placing these into a transfer crate at **Area 5** (Region 3, G–J, Columns 17–20), to be set aside for waste disposal or return.
  - Repeats this cycle with multiple trips between **Region 1** and **Region 3**, causing frequent crossings of shared corridors, particularly Row E and Columns 4/9/13–20.

#### **Worker 2: Storage and Replenishment Operator**
- **Primary role:** Relocate sorted/approved items from operational zones to final storage, while also restocking frequently accessed shelves and handling overflow.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Collects inspected and approved items from **Area 2** (Region 3, Columns 9–12).
  - Navigates the **main pathway (Row F and up through Columns 10–20)** toward the shelves, depositing items onto **Shelf 2 or Shelf 3** (Region 2, Columns 12–16).
  - Periodically restocks consolidated overflow to **Large Shelf 2 or 3** (Region 4, L–M, Columns 6–14), using lower corridor (Row L) and Columns 9/13.
  - Returns to operational zones for the next batch, crossing through shared grid points and sometimes using Area 3 as a staging buffer if the main path is congested.

---

### **Robot: Autonomous Waste Disposal**
- Starts at **G19, Area 5**, programmed to pick up the transfer crate of waste prepared by Worker 1.
- **Route:** G19 → G3 (Waste Area), strictly along Row G due to the crate’s weight and optimal pathing (as per given waypoints).
- The robot only moves when it detects the full crate in Area 5 (triggered by Worker 1 physically filling it).

---

### **Dynamic Interactions and Environmental Complexity**

#### **Shared Area and Task Overlap:**
- Both workers frequently occupy and traverse **Areas 1–3, Row F/G/H** for sorting, staging, and putaway.
- Worker 1 and Worker 2 often meet or queue at Area 2, requiring navigation around each other and any temporary stacks of product.
- Both may temporarily set down boxes near column 9–13, further complicating the workspace.

#### **Indirect Robot-Human Interactions:**
- Worker 1’s transfer of the filled crate to Area 5 triggers the robot’s environmental response (robot detects presence of waste).
- As the robot moves leftward along Row G, Worker 2 may be crossing through or standing in the operational corridor, perhaps carrying inventory toward Shelf 3 or staging for putaway into Area 3.
- Worker 1 may also be transferring the next box or returning empty-handed via Row G or H, occasionally stopping to stack or move empty crates, causing intermittent, temporary blockages along the robot’s intended route.
- The robot must detect and safely navigate around humans, paused boxes, or cart obstacles along its route, possibly slowing or pausing until the path is clear, but never receiving explicit directions or prompts from the workers.

---

### **Operational Realism**
- **Role justification:** Sorting and inspection usually follows large receipts—generated waste/crate removal is common and may require urgent clearing if space is at a premium.
- **Shared-space complexity:** Two workers in a mid-sized warehouse must often perform overlapping actions, especially when workflow peaks converge (sorting and putaway post-receipt), creating congestion, shared resource dependencies, and frequent local rerouting.
- **Robot operation:** Automated waste transport is standard in modern facilities but is constrained by human activities—here authentically shown through spatial-temporal overlap, shared corridors, and indirect influence from worker activity, in strict alignment with requirements.

---

**Scenario Summary (JSON):**
```json
{
  "scenario": "Following a busy receipt, Worker 1 repeatedly retrieves mixed inventory from Boxes 1–2 in Region 1, carries each load to Areas 1–2 for inspection and sorting, then places damaged or unneeded items in a crate at Area 5 for disposal. Worker 2 simultaneously collects approved items from Area 2, delivers them to Shelf 2–3 in Region 2, or restocks Large Shelves 2–3 in Region 4, traversing shared corridors and frequently crossing paths with Worker 1. Once Worker 1 fills the waste crate at Area 5, the autonomous robot, starting at G19, detects the item and transports it to the Waste Area at G3 exclusively along Row G. During the robot's route, both workers may temporarily block the path due to shared sorting, moving, or staging tasks, requiring the robot to slow or pause as it autonomously avoids obstacles, with all interactions triggered by dynamic workspace changes rather than any direct communication."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**Worker 1: Inventory Sorter/Inspector**

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**  
1. **Boxes 1 → Area 1**  
2. **Area 1 → Area 2**  
3. **Area 2 → Area 5**  
4. **Area 5 → Boxes 1**

**Reasoning:**
- **Boxes 1 → Area 1:** Worker 1 starts by picking up inventory from "Boxes 1" in Region 1 and transports it to "Area 1" for initial sorting and inspection, reflecting the role of bringing in new stock for quality check.
- **Area 1 → Area 2:** After sorting, suitable items are moved to "Area 2" for staging, providing clear separation between inspected/approved goods and those still under review or requiring further action.
- **Area 2 → Area 5:** Any damaged or rejected items are then taken from "Area 2" and placed into a crate in "Area 5", which serves as the collection area for waste, aligning with the scenario's disposal workflow.
- **Area 5 → Boxes 1:** After drop-off, Worker 1 returns to "Boxes 1", ready to repeat the cycle with the next incoming bulk inventory. This closed loop ensures continuous inspection and triage of inbound stock across critical sort and disposal touchpoints.

---

**Worker 2: Storage and Replenishment Operator**

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**  
1. **Area 2 → Shelf 2**  
2. **Shelf 2 → Large Shelf 2**  
3. **Large Shelf 2 → Area 3**  
4. **Area 3 → Area 2**

**Reasoning:**
- **Area 2 → Shelf 2:** Worker 2 starts by taking approved/inspected items staged in "Area 2" and shelving them at "Shelf 2", supporting immediate putaway of sorted inventory.
- **Shelf 2 → Large Shelf 2:** If there are overflow or less frequently needed items, they are transported from "Shelf 2" to "Large Shelf 2" to ensure optimal use of high-access shelving and long-term storage capacity.
- **Large Shelf 2 → Area 3:** From "Large Shelf 2", Worker 2 uses "Area 3" as a flexible staging point, perhaps to buffer items awaiting further directions or to regroup for an efficient next run.
- **Area 3 → Area 2:** Worker 2 returns to "Area 2" to repeat the cycle, collecting the next batch of staged items for putaway or consolidation. This sequence ensures continuous movement between staging, storage, and overflow consolidation, supporting overall warehouse flow and minimizing congestion in operational hotspots.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.

  - Efficient and obstacle-free.

---

**Notes on Edge Point Usage and Efficiency:**  
- Routes frequently employ edge points (e.g., A14, M12, E1, G3) as required by both operational demands (access to shelves/storage) and area valid waypoints.
- All movement patterns leverage primary warehouse corridors, allowing for minimal maneuvering and reduced congestion, while strictly honoring invalid waypoints.
- Route selection ensures that robot navigation could be indirectly and dynamically influenced by worker flow and congestion, especially where corridors are shared.



========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.

**Correction:**  
- To avoid F1 and reach G6: Use E1 → E3 (Boxes 1 exit point), then go right to G6.
- E3 is a shared valid waypoint between Boxes 1 and Boxes 2 and allows transition to the main corridor.
- Corrected valid pathway:  
  [E1, E2, E3, F4, G4, G5, G6]  
  (**E2** and **E3** are valid for Boxes 1, F4 is not listed as invalid, G4/G5/G6 valid for Area 1.)

### **Step 2: Area 1 → Area 2**  
**Original Path:** [G6, G7, G8]

#### **Validation:**

1. **Start/End Validity:**  
   - **G6:** Valid (Area 1).  
   - **G8:** Valid (Area 2).

2. **Invalid Waypoints in Path:**  
   - All are valid waypoints.

3. **Area Waypoint Rule:**  
   - All in-area points are area-valid.

4. **Continuity:**  
   - Sequential, no gaps.

**Errors:**  
- None.

**Correction:**  
- Path is valid as written.  
  **[G6, G7, G8]**

### **Step 3: Area 2 → Area 5**  
**Original Path:** [G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19]

#### **Validation:**

1. **Start/End Validity:**  
   - **G8:** Valid (Area 2).
   - **G19:** Valid (Area 5).

2. **Invalid Waypoints in Path:**  
   - All are valid waypoints (G1, G2, G22 are the only G-row invalids).

   - G8: Area 2 valid.
   - G9-G10: Area 2 valid.
   - G11-G14: Area 3 valid.
   - G15-G17: Area 4 valid.
   - G18-G19: Area 5 valid.

4. **Continuity:**  
   - Sequential, correct.

**Errors:**  
- None.

**Correction:**  
- Path is valid as written.  
  **[G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19]**

---

### **Step 4: Area 5 → Boxes 1**  
**Original Path:** [G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, F4, F1, E1]

#### **Validation:**

1. **Start/End Validity:**  
   - **G19:** Valid (Area 5).  
   - **E1:** Valid (Boxes 1).

2. **Invalid Waypoints in Path:**  
   - **F1** in the path is invalid.

3. **Area Waypoint Rule:**  
   - G19-G18: Area 5 valid.
   - G17-G15: Area 4 valid.
   - G14-G11: Area 3 valid.
   - G10-G7: Area 2 valid.
   - G6-G4: Area 1 valid.
   - F4: General transition (not area-specific).
   - F1: Invalid.
   - E1: Boxes 1 valid.

4. **Continuity:**  
   - Path is sequential but interrupted by the invalid F1.

**Errors:**  
- F1 is invalid.

**Correction:**  
- Instead of dropping to F1, use E3 as a transition (Boxes 1 allows E3 as valid entry).
- Corrected path: [G19, G18, G17, G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, F4, E3, E2, E1]
  - (F4 is not invalid, E3/E2/E1 all valid for Boxes 1.)
---

#### **Worker 1 Summary**
- **All segments now begin/end at valid points, replace F1 with legal route via E3/E2/E1 per area rules.**
- **Paths now form a closed loop, stay within valid/area-approved points, and offer continuous movement without gaps.**

## **Worker 2: Storage and Replenishment Operator**

### **Step 1: Area 2 → Shelf 2**  
**Original Path:** [G9, F9, E9, D12, C12, B12, A12, A14]

#### **Validation:**

1. **Start/End Validity:**  
   - **G9:** Valid (Area 2).
   - **A14:** Valid (Shelf 2).

2. **Invalid Waypoints in Path:**  
   - **F9, E9, D12, C12, B12, A12, A14:** Must check for each.
     - F9: Not invalid.
     - E9: Not listed as invalid.
     - D12: Not listed as invalid.
     - C12: Not listed as invalid.
     - B12: Not listed as invalid.
     - A12: Not listed as invalid.

3. **Area Waypoint Rule:**  
   - G9: Area 2 valid.
   - D12, C12, B12, A12: Shelf 1 valid, but the target is Shelf 2.
   - A12, B12, C12, D12: Also valid for Shelf 2.
   - A14: Shelf 2 valid.

4. **Continuity:**  
   - Sequential, continuous.

**Errors:**  
- All waypoints used after Area 2 are valid for either Shelf 1 or Shelf 2. Technically, D12/B12/A12/C12 are valid for Shelf 2 access.

**Correction:**  
- The path is valid, but for directness and strict area adherence, it might be clearer to use area access points explicitly.  
- Alternate direct path: [G9, F9, E9, D12, C12, B12, A12, A14]
- This is compliant as given.

   - K14/L12/M12: Check for invalid — all are not listed as invalid.

3. **Area Waypoint Rule:**  
   - Path only enters Large Shelf 2 at M12 (valid).
   - A14 etc. are valid as Shelf 2 access points.

4. **Continuity:**  
   - Sequential, continuous.

**Errors:**  
- All valid.

**Correction:**  
- No revision needed; path is valid.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
