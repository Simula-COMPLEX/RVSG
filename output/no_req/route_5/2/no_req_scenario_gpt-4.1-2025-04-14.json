  "scenario": "Following a busy receipt, Worker 1 repeatedly retrieves mixed inventory from Boxes 1–2 in Region 1, carries each load to Areas 1–2 for inspection and sorting, then places damaged or unneeded items in a crate at Area 5 for disposal. Worker 2 simultaneously collects approved items from Area 2, delivers them to Shelf 2–3 in Region 2, or restocks Large Shelves 2–3 in Region 4, traversing shared corridors and frequently crossing paths with Worker 1. Once Worker 1 fills the waste crate at Area 5, the autonomous robot, starting at G19, detects the item and transports it to the Waste Area at G3 exclusively along Row G. During the robot's route, both workers may temporarily block the path due to shared sorting, moving, or staging tasks, requiring the robot to slow or pause as it autonomously avoids obstacles, with all interactions triggered by dynamic workspace changes rather than any direct communication.",
