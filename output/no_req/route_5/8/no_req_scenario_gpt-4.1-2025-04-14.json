  "scenario": "During a busy receiving period, Worker 1 unloads and stages new goods in Area 5, then uses the pallet jack to transfer these items to Areas 1 and 2 for sorting and inspection. Worker 2 conducts quality inspection in Areas 1 and 2, separating defective items and repeatedly transporting waste to the Waste Area along Row G. Meanwhile, the autonomous robot begins at G19 (Area 5), detects the presence of a filled waste bin, and autonomously travels leftward through G19–G3 to the Waste Area, pausing or rerouting if its path is blocked by workers, the pallet jack, or staged items. Both human workers frequently operate in overlapping and adjacent areas along the robot's route, causing natural, indirect environmental influences that occasionally slow or divert the robot, but all roles and interactions are governed by real workflow needs and physical layout constraints.",
