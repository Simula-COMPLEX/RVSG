  "scenario": "During peak receiving, Worker 1 unloads deliveries from Large Shelf 1/2 and Boxes 1–3, transporting items to sorting Areas 1–2 for preliminary categorization. Worker 2 inspects sorted items in Areas 1–2, transfers usable stock to Shelves 1–4, and places rejected or waste items in Area 5. When waste accumulates in Area 5, the autonomous robot, detecting the environmental state, initiates a disposal run along Row G from G19 to the Waste Area at G3, sharing pathways with Worker 2, who concurrently clears waste or switches between tasks, sometimes causing temporary path blockages and forcing the robot to alter or delay its route. Both workers operate independently but frequently overlap in Areas 1–2, Area 5, and near the aisles, with all interactions shaped by operational workflow, not direct communication. Human activity indirectly influences the robot via environmental obstacles and moving objects, creating realistic congestion and navigation delays typical of a busy multi-process warehouse.",
