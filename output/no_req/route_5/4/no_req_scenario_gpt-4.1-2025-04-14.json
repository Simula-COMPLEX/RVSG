  "scenario": "During a morning inbound processing period, Worker 1 receives and unpacks new deliveries in Area 5, sorts items for reuse in Area 1, and disposes of packaging and rejects in the Waste Area. Simultaneously, Worker 2 retrieves sorted goods from Area 1, inspects them, and transfers them to Boxes 1–3 or Large Shelves 1–4 for storage, while also removing damaged items from storage to the Waste Area. Both workers frequently use the main horizontal corridor (Row G), often crossing paths at the Waste Area and operational zones. Meanwhile, an autonomous robot, tasked with transporting a waste item from Area 5 to the Waste Area using the G19 → G3 route, must dynamically adjust its movement and occasionally pause due to Both workers’ activities indirectly blocking or congesting its navigation waypoints. No direct communication occurs; the robot’s responses are based purely on environmental changes, resulting in naturally emergent, high-activity human-robot coexistence in shared work zones.",
