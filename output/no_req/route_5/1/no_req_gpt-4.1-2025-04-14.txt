========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations scenario planner. Your role is to create a realistic and practical operational use case based on the provided warehouse layout and the specific requirements described below. Do not include any direct communication or command exchange between humans and the robot. All robot reactions should be triggered by environmental changes only.


Provided Known Information:

1. Warehouse Layout Description (from Image 1):
The first image depicts a warehouse layout divided into four main regions: Region 1 contains Boxes 1–3, Region 2 holds Shelf 1–6, Region 3 includes operational zones Area 1–5 and a Waste Area, and Region 4 contains Large Shelf 1–4. Storage units are categorized as boxes, shelves, and large shelves, with boxes placed on the left for bulk storage, shelves centrally aligned for frequently accessed items, and large shelves along the bottom for bulky or less-used stock. Operational zones in Region 3 are used for sorting, inspection, staging, and dispatch, with Areas 1 and 2 holding items and Areas 3 and 4 empty. The Waste Area is isolated for non-usable materials. A pallet jack is positioned near Area 5 for handling tasks such as receiving, internal transport, and dispatch. Movement pathways run horizontally and vertically, with central corridors providing access across regions. Safety features include hazard markings, while some shelving arrangements and equipment placement present possible movement constraints.

2. Waypoint Navigation Grid (from Image 2):
The second image overlays the same warehouse with a coordinate grid (Rows A–M, Columns 1–22) and a waypoint network where only solid blue dots denote valid navigation points. Region 1 spans A–E, Columns 1–9; Region 2 spans A–E, Columns 10–22; Region 3 occupies F–J, Columns 1–21 and includes Waste Area (F–J, 1–4) and Areas 1–5; Region 4 spans L–M, Columns 1–22. Pathways are defined along Rows E, F, K, and L for horizontal movement and Columns 1, 4, 9, and 22 for vertical transitions, enabling access between zones. Storage zones are bordered by waypoints that support side or front access for picking and placing. Operational zones are surrounded by valid waypoints to allow entry and exit from multiple sides, with each area aligned for specific workflow stages. The pallet jack is located at G–H, Column 22, directly accessible via adjacent waypoints and connected to dispatch and storage areas through primary grid corridors.

3. Robot Navigation Route:
The robot starts near grid point G19 in Area 5, and travels leftward along row G, moving from column 19 to column 3, and ends around G3 in Waste Area. The approximate waypoints it passes through are: G19 → G18 → G17 → G16 → G15 → G14 → G13 → G12 → G11 → G10 → G9 → G8 → G7 → G6 → G5 → G4 → G3. This route suggests the robot is likely performing a disposal task, picking up an item from Area 5 and delivering it to the Waste Area for discarding or recycling.


Special Requirements:

When designing the operational scenario, you are encouraged to include complex cases in which both human workers may perform similar or overlapping tasks, operate within the same functional area(s), or have frequent task, spatial, and timing crossovers. Consider not only traditional division-of-labor situations, but also real-world high-activity scenarios where workers collaborate, alternate, or independently repeat similar processes in close proximity or shared zones. These scenarios may feature frequent mutual interference, shared resource use, and dynamic spatial congestion.

Note:
- There is no direct communication or command exchange between the human workers and the robot.
- The robot operates completely autonomously and only reacts to changes in the physical environment (e.g., detecting new obstacles), not to any explicit instructions or signals from humans.
- Any influence of the workers on the robot is indirect and arises solely from their activities in the shared workspace, such as moving objects, occupying certain locations, or causing temporary obstructions.


You must:
- Define a realistic operational use case involving activities such as receiving, sorting, inspection, storage, or dispatch.
- Involve only two human workers.
- Clearly assign either distinct or collaborative operational roles and responsibilities to each worker. Workers may perform complementary, alternating, or similar/cooperative tasks if operationally realistic.
- Ensure that worker tasks involve physical movement across multiple or shared functional areas of the warehouse, referencing the provided warehouse zones and layout description.
- Ensure that all worker tasks emerge from legitimate workflow requirements, not intentional interference or contrived positioning.
- Do not include any direct interaction between humans and the robot. All robot responses must be based solely on environmental factors.
- Provide a detailed explanation of why the scenario is operationally realistic and how each worker’s role fits within the warehouse layout and overall process flow.
- Provide a concise natural language scenario summary as a JSON object with the key "scenario" only.
- Strictly following all requirements above, provide a detailed, step-by-step scenario analysis in natural language. Output only the scenario summary in JSON format as the last part of your answer. Do not output the JSON alone, and do not merge the analysis and JSON. Both sections are required and must be clearly separated. If the analysis section is missing, the answer is incomplete.


==================================================


**Detailed, Step-by-Step Scenario Analysis**

### Operational Context
This scenario simulates a typical workflow during a peak period where warehouse efficiency is critical—such as end-of-day bulk clean-up, returns processing, and inventory management. Both human workers participate in related but partially overlapping task chains in shared regions, leading to frequent indirect interaction with the autonomous robot, which is tasked with waste disposal.

---

**Worker 1: Returns and Inspection Specialist**
- **Primary Responsibilities:**
  - Retrieve returned items from the Large Shelves (Region 4: Large Shelf 1 and 2, located L1–M8).
  - Transport returned items to Area 1 or Area 2 (Region 3: G5–I9) for inspection and initial processing.
  - Conduct inspection and decide on disposition: restock, send for further processing, or dispose of non-salvageable items.

- **Movement Pattern:**
  - Starts at Large Shelf 1 or 2 along the bottom (L2–L8).
  - Moves up via pathway at Column 4 or 9, then along Row G or H to Area 1/2.
  - After inspecting items, may occasionally move some items directly to Waste Area (F2-4) or to areas for further processing.
  - May re-enter storage areas or operational zones for additional items, often crossing the central pathway.

---

**Worker 2: General Sorter & Staging Operator**
- **Primary Responsibilities:**
  - Collect mixed/unsorted goods from Boxes 2–3 (Region 1: C4–C9).
  - Move these items to Areas 4 and 5 (Region 3: G14–G21) for sorting and staging for either dispatch, storage, or disposal.
  - Identify items for discard and aggregate disposables for waste handling.
  - Occasionally transport selected sorted items to the appropriate shelves or restock locations, or prepare outgoing items for dispatch.

- **Movement Pattern:**
  - Starts at Boxes 2–3 in Region 1 and moves via Column 9 corridor and Row F/G pathway to Areas 4 and 5.
  - Transports unsorted goods and, after sorting, redistributes items as needed (including returning unsalvageable goods to the Waste Area).
  - May move through Row G, occasionally passing through the operational Area 5 (G19), staging sorted waste and readying it for the robot pickup.
  - Travels back and forth, increasing the spatial and task congestion near Areas 4 and 5, as well as the main navigation path used by the robot.

---

### Shared Task Dynamics and Mutual Environmental Impacts

- **Area Overlap:**  
  - Both workers frequently use the central corridor (E–G, 9–19) and the operational zones (Areas 1, 2, 4, and 5) for sorting and staging returns or disposals.
  - The Waste Area (F–G, 2–4) is a common endpoint for both, increasing the chance of temporary blockage or object placement in the robot’s path.

- **Resources and Space Congestion:**
  - The pallet jack near Area 5 (H22) may be repositioned by either worker for larger item movement, sometimes obstructing waypoints or temporarily blocking narrow grid columns (19–22) used by the robot for disposal runs.
  - Large items or stacks placed by workers in Areas 4 and 5 (G14–G21) can create dynamic, unpredictable obstacles on the robot’s leftward route from G19 to G3.
  - Workers’ presence in Row G slows robot progress, especially if a worker is stationary near the Waste Area, forcing the robot to pause or reroute as needed.

- **No Direct Communication:**
  - Workers focus solely on their tasks, occasionally pausing to maneuver around each other but never addressing or signaling the robot.
  - The robot detects new obstacles or blockages only through its sensors, waiting or rerouting through valid waypoints.

---

### Robot’s Task and Environmental Reactions

- **Task**: The robot’s assigned task is to pick up a collection of sorted waste items from Area 5 (G19) and transport them to the Waste Area (G3).
- **Environmental Interactions:**
  - During its leftward journey, it frequently encounters the two workers, who are alternately moving items, standing, or temporarily placing objects in shared pathways along Rows G/H.
  - If a worker momentarily blocks Row G or stacks a box on a waypoint, the robot’s sensors detect the new obstruction. The robot then:
    - Pauses until the obstacle clears—if the obstruction is temporary (e.g., a worker is just passing).
    - Or, if the obstacle persists, the robot considers a local reroute (e.g., temporarily diverting up or down one row using adjacent available waypoints, such as Row F or H, then rejoining Row G as soon as the path is clear).
  - The robot may also wait at its endpoint G3 if the Waste Area is actively occupied by a worker offloading items, resuming its drop-off only when the area becomes accessible.

---

### Why This Scenario Is Operationally Realistic

- Return and sorting tasks, waste handling, and movement of goods across inbound and outbound zones are routine in warehouse operations and are often performed by multiple workers in shared spaces.
- The introduction of an autonomous robot for waste handling reflects industry trends for automation and is realistic in a setting where robot-human coactivity is normalized, especially during busy periods.
- High activity near sorting/staging (Areas 4–5), waste zones, and central corridors is typical, especially when returns and disposal volumes are high or end-of-day processing is underway.
- Worker roles and movements are chosen to match realistic division of labor, but spatial overlap is unavoidable due to warehouse layout and workflow requirements.

---

**SCENARIO SUMMARY (JSON):**
```json
{
  "scenario": "Two human workers operate in overlapping warehouse zones while an autonomous robot performs waste disposal. Worker 1 retrieves returned items from Large Shelves (Region 4), brings them to Areas 1–2 for inspection, and occasionally discards unusable goods in the Waste Area. Worker 2 transports unsorted goods from Boxes 2–3 (Region 1) to Areas 4–5, sorts them, stages outgoing items for dispatch, and collects disposables for discarding. Both workers move frequently between operational areas, often occupying the same corridors and staging sites used by the robot, creating dynamic, unintentional obstacles. The robot autonomously collects waste from Area 5, traverses Row G leftward (G19 to G3) to the Waste Area, and responds only to physical obstructions caused by ongoing human activities, pausing or rerouting as needed when waypoints or drop-off points are blocked."
}
```


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse operations process designer. Using the warehouse layout and the previously defined operational scenario, your task is to design a high-level cyclic task sequence for each of the two human workers.

Special Requirements:
There is no direct communication or command exchange between the workers and the robot; the robot operates autonomously and only reacts to environmental changes caused by the workers’ actions in the warehouse.

Your instructions must:
- Base the design strictly on the previously defined operational scenario.
- Use only functional area names (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- Ensure that the end location of each task is the start of the next.
- Ensure the final task returns to the worker’s starting location, forming a complete loop.
- Explain your reasoning for the order and selection of each functional area in the task sequence, including how it supports the operational goal and each worker's role.


==================================================


**Worker 1: Returns and Inspection Specialist**

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**  
1. **Large Shelf 1 → Area 1**  
   *Worker collects returned items from Large Shelf 1 and transports them to Area 1 for initial inspection. Large Shelf 1 is the typical location for recently received returns or stored unchecked returns.*

2. **Area 1 → Waste Area**  
   *After inspecting items in Area 1, the worker identifies unsalvageable or damaged goods and carries them directly to the Waste Area for disposal. Only truly non-usable returns take this leg; other items may be restocked or set aside for further processing, but waste items align this step with the scenario’s primary disposal workflow.*

3. **Waste Area → Large Shelf 1**  
   *Once the worker has dropped off disposed items in the Waste Area, the worker returns to Large Shelf 1 to begin the next cycle, searching for more returns to inspect. This closes the loop and sustains the continuous returns-inspection-disposal cycle that fits the operational scenario.*

**Reasoning:**  
- The cycle reflects the typical flow of returns: retrieval, inspection, and disposition.
- The route ensures spatial variety—crossing from storage (Region 4) to operational (Region 3) and waste handling, maximizing use of shared space and the potential for route overlap with the robot.
- Each step ends where the next starts for seamless cyclic operation, supporting efficient workflow without wasting motion.
- This sequence maintains the worker’s focus on inspecting and sorting returns, with clear points for moving unusable goods out of circulation.

---

**Worker 2: General Sorter & Staging Operator**

**Cyclic Task Sequence:**  
1. **Boxes 2 → Area 5**  
   *Worker starts at Boxes 2, collects unsorted goods, and transports them to Area 5 for sorting. Boxes 2 is a primary bulk input location for unsorted or new goods.*

2. **Area 5 → Area 4**  
   *In Area 5, the worker sorts goods and stages sorted items. Selects items that belong in Area 4 (e.g., for dispatch or further organization) and carries them over; this reinforces flow between staging/sorting as described in the scenario.*

3. **Area 4 → Waste Area**  
   *After staging items in Area 4, the worker gathers identified waste materials or packaging from Area 4 and brings them to the Waste Area, contributing to the overall warehouse disposal task.*

4. **Waste Area → Boxes 2**  
   *Once the waste is deposited, the worker returns to Boxes 2 to begin the next loop, ensuring the workflow is continuous and returns to the original source area.*

**Reasoning:**  
- This cycle matches the core functionality of moving unsorted goods from bulk storage, sorting, and staging, then handling waste byproduct from the process—a realistic workflow in busy receiving and sorting operations.
- The inclusion of both Areas 4 and 5 (instead of using only one) increases staging flexibility and reflects a need for task switching and area sharing, boosting realism and route overlap with the robot.
- The loop maximizes use of the operational areas as sorting and staging hubs and ensures that contact with the Waste Area coincides with the robot’s typical operating corridor, which also increases potential environmental interactions.
- The flow ensures minimal backtracking and that every leg of the route is justifiable based on real warehouse work patterns.

---

**Summary**  
Both workers’ cycles are designed according to the operational roles and functional workflow from the scenario. The sequences utilize shared paths and zones with the robot, sustaining high activity and efficient turnover in key warehouse areas. Every task supports the operational objectives—returns inspection, sorting, and waste management—while ensuring a logical and repeatable loop.

You are a warehouse navigation route planner. Based on the high-level task sequences for each worker, your job is to generate detailed waypoint-based movement paths for each step. Follow the special requirements, area valid waypoints, warehouse invalid waypoints, and navigation rules to ensure all routes are valid and efficient.


Special Requirements:

All such influences on the robot must arise solely from the way the workers navigate and use the space, without any direct communication or interaction with the robot itself.

When designing task sequences or navigation routes, do not restrict valid waypoints to only the central or mid-grid areas. Always consider edge waypoints, like those on rows A and B (e.g., A12, B16, A22), as potential and legitimate start, end, or transit points, especially for any operation that involves shelves or storage zones located at or near the warehouse boundaries.


Area Valid Waypoints:
Define the following valid waypoints for each warehouse area:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22
Use these exact waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points for navigation tasks within each respective area.


Warehouse Invalid Waypoints:
Some waypoints are explicitly unavailable due to obstructions, physical layout, or operational constraints. These waypoints must never be used under any circumstances. Ensure that all planned routes avoid the following invalid waypoints:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21
Always cross-check your route against this list to ensure validity.


Navigation Rules:
- Use only valid navigation points (solid blue dots).
- Each path must start exactly where the previous one ended.
- Include both the start and end points in the path.
- Always avoid the specified invalid waypoints.
- For any task involving a specific area, always use only the waypoints listed in that area's Area Valid Waypoints as possible start, end, or intermediate points.
- Always consider and use edge points as start, end, or intermediate waypoints when they are valid for the area.


For each step in each worker’s task sequence, you must provide:
- Start coordinate (e.g., C9).
- End coordinate (e.g., G6).
- Full waypoint path as an ordered list, including both the start and end points (e.g., [C9, D9, E9, E8, E7, E6, F6, G6]).
- Explanation of why this route was chosen, (if applicable) how edge waypoints are used, how it avoids obstacles and invalid waypoints, and why it is efficient given the warehouse layout.


==================================================


**Worker 1: Returns and Inspection Specialist**

### Step 1: Large Shelf 1 → Area 1
- **Start:** M2 (Large Shelf 1 area valid waypoint, edge point)
- **End:** G4 (Area 1 valid waypoint)
- **Full Waypoint Path:**  
  [M2, L2, K2, J2, I2, H2, G2, G3, G4]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Starts at the edge (M2), using the row M edge position of Large Shelf 1.
  - Moves up column 2 through L, K, and J—these are wide warehouse lanes.
  - J2, I2, and H2 are all valid, approaching G2 (noted as invalid), so adjustment is needed.
  - **Correction:** Since G2 is invalid, take the path to F3 instead—using F3 as the adjacent allowed entry to the Area 1 region, then move to G4:
  - **Valid Full Path:**  
    [M2, L2, K2, J2, I2, H2, F3, G3, G4]
  - Path enters Area 1 via the bottom (G4), fits legitimate human ingress from the southern edge, uses only valid waypoints, and passes through the warehouse’s least congested perimeter.

---

### Step 2: Area 1 → Waste Area
- **Start:** G4 (Area 1 valid waypoint)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area valid waypoint)
- **Full Waypoint Path:**  
  [G4, G3]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Direct lateral move from G4 to G3, both valid points for their respective areas.
  - Efficient and straightforward, traces legitimate flow for transferring waste material from the inspection zone to disposal.

---

### Step 3: Waste Area → Large Shelf 1
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area valid waypoint)
- **End:** M2 (Large Shelf 1 valid/edge waypoint)
- **Full Waypoint Path:**  
  [G3, F3, H2, I2, J2, K2, L2, M2]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Reverses the ingress path to Large Shelf 1.
  - Uses F3 to drop quickly to an open corridor, then rises along the left edge across valid points (with J2, I2, etc., all listed as valid non-obstructed points).
  - Any congestion near Row G or central areas is bypassed using this edge-dominant route, honoring warehouse flow efficiency.

---

**Worker 2: General Sorter & Staging Operator**

### Step 1: Boxes 2 → Area 5
- **Start:** E4 (Boxes 2 area valid waypoint)
- **End:** G19 (Area 5 valid waypoint)
- **Full Waypoint Path:**  
  [E4, F4, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14, G15, G16, G17, G18, G19]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Starts at E4 (Boxes 2), moves straight south to Row G (passing through F4, which is valid here).
  - Travels along Row G through shared operational and staging areas, using the “main working corridor.”
  - Arrives at G19 (Area 5), utilizing shared congestion-prone but efficient path for large bulk item movement, and does not use any listed invalid point.
  - G4 as an early step further multiplies overlap potential with the other worker and the robot.

---

### Step 2: Area 5 → Area 4
- **Start:** G19 (Area 5 valid waypoint)
- **End:** G16 (Area 4 valid waypoint)
- **Full Waypoint Path:**  
  [G19, G18, G17, G16]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Direct move westbound along Row G through valid Area 5 and Area 4 waypoints.
  - Quickest and smoothest transition between two staging or dispatch areas for processed and sorted items.

---

### Step 3: Area 4 → Waste Area
- **Start:** G16 (Area 4 valid waypoint)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area valid waypoint)
- **Full Waypoint Path:**  
  [G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Moves along Row G westward, using all valid and unbroken waypoints (G15 through G3).
  - Mirrors the actual stretch the robot uses for its waste run.
  - Ensures maximum operational realism and potential space sharing or congestion with both the other worker and the robot.

---

### Step 4: Waste Area → Boxes 2
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area valid waypoint)
- **End:** E4 (Boxes 2 valid waypoint)
- **Full Waypoint Path:**  
  [G3, F3, E3, E4]
- **Explanation:**  
  - Returns up the grid to Row F and then eastward to Row E, then right to E4 (Boxes 2).
  - This upward approach minimizes travel through activity-heavy central aisles and avoids all invalid points.
  - Re-enters the cycle at the Boxes 2 edge, ready for the next bulk sort round.

**All routes start and end at valid waypoints, maximize spatial efficiency, use edge access points where applicable, respect all invalid waypoints, and reflect realistic, collision-prone high-activity warehouse flow.**


========================================================================================================================================================================================================


You are a warehouse route validation specialist. Your task is to carefully review all previously generated waypoint paths for each worker, according to the following requirements:

Check that the start point, end point, and every waypoint in each path are all valid and not listed as blocked or unavailable.

Ensure that all task transitions are continuous: the end point of each step must exactly match the start point of the next step.

Confirm that each worker’s full path forms a closed loop, returning to their original starting point.

Verify that all routes respect the physical layout and functional roles: for example, shelves are accessed from designated access points, and blocked or restricted zones are avoided.

When a task step involves a specific area, any waypoints used within that area must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list:
- Boxes 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3
- Boxes 2: E3, E4, E5, E6
- Boxes 3: E6, E7, E8, D9, C9, B9, A9
- Shelf 1: A9, B9, C9, D9, A12, B12, C12, D12
- Shelf 2: A12, B12, C12, D12, A14, B14, C14, D14
- Shelf 3: A14, B14, C14, D14, A16, B16, C16, D16
- Shelf 4: A16, B16, C16, D16, A18, B18, C18, D18
- Shelf 5: A18, B18, C18, D18, A20, B20, C20, D20
- Shelf 6: A20, B20, C20, D20, A22, B22, C22, D22
- Waste Area: F3, G3
- Area 1: G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4
- Area 2: G7, G8, G9, G10
- Area 3: G11, G12, G13, G14, H11, H12, H13, H14, I11, I12, I13, I14, J11, J12, J13, J14
- Area 4: G15, G16, G17, H15, H16, H17, I15, I16, I17, J15, J16, J17
- Area 5: G18, G19, G20, G21, H18, H19, H20, H21
- Pallet Jack: F22, G21, H21, I22
- Large Shelf 1: M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7
- Large Shelf 2: M8, M9, M10, M11, M12
- Large Shelf 3: M13, M14, M15, M16, M17
- Large Shelf 4: M18, M19, M20, M21, M22

All planned routes must avoid the following invalid waypoints at all times:
- Row A: A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, A21
- Row B: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B10, B11, B13, B15, B17, B19, B21
- Row C: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C10, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21
- Row D: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21
- Row F: F1, F2
- Row G: G1, G2, G22
- Row H: H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H22
- Row I: I1, I2, I3, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I18, I19, I20, I21
- Row J: J1, J2, J3, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J18, J19, J20, J21


For every path segment, validate the following in order:
- The start and end coordinates are valid and permitted.
- Every waypoint in the path is valid and not listed as invalid.
- When a task step involves a specific area, all in-area waypoints must be selected only from that area's Area Valid Waypoints list.
- The path is continuous, with no gaps or jumps between steps.
- The full sequence forms a closed loop, returning to the starting point.

For each path segment, list all validation errors you find (such as invalid waypoints, discontinuities, or area-valid-waypoint issues), and then propose a revised, valid route that preserves the intended task flow logic.

Do not stop at the first error. Check the entire segment thoroughly before suggesting corrections. After completing the validation and correction for the current segment, move on to the next segment and repeat the process.

### Worker 1: Returns and Inspection Specialist

---

#### **Step 1: Large Shelf 1 → Area 1**
- **Original Path:** [M2, L2, K2, J2, I2, H2, F3, G3, G4]
- **Start:** M2 (valid Large Shelf 1, edge)
- **End:** G4 (valid Area 1)

**Waypoint Validation:**
- M2: Valid (Large Shelf 1)
- L2: Not explicitly listed as invalid.
- K2: Not explicitly listed as invalid.
- J2: **Invalid** (Row J: J2 is on the invalid list)
- I2: **Invalid** (Row I: I2 is on the invalid list)
- H2: **Invalid** (Row H: H2 is on the invalid list)
- F3: Valid
- G3: Valid (Waste Area only, not Area 1)
- G4: Valid (Area 1)

**Area Valid Waypoints:**  
- Must enter Area 1 only via G4, G5, G6, G7, H4, I4, J4.

**Errors:**
- Path passes through J2, I2, and H2, all of which are explicitly invalid.
- Entering Area 1 must use its valid waypoints.
- Route briefly passes through G3 (Waste Area), which is valid, but not for Area 1.

**Correction:**
Find a valid corridor from M2 (Large Shelf 1) to G4 (Area 1), avoiding J2/I2/H2 and only using valid non-restricted waypoints.  
We must leave Row M via column 2 or through other allowed points, and likely use column 4 (which is accessible and not listed as invalid).

**Proposed revised path:**
- Start at M2 (Large Shelf 1). Move up to L2 (allowed), but then need to move horizontally as J2 is blocked.
- Move horizontally to L4 (not listed as invalid) and up to K4, J4 (valid for Area 1). 
- From J4 (which is an Area 1 valid waypoint), move down to I4, H4, and to G4.

**Step-by-step:**
- M2, L2, L4, K4, J4, I4, H4, G4

Let’s verify:
- L4: Not invalid.
- K4: Not invalid.
- J4: Valid and listed for Area 1.
- I4, H4, G4: All valid for Area 1.

**Final Valid Path:**  
[M2, L2, L4, K4, J4, I4, H4, G4]  
(Enter Area 1 at J4, exit at G4 for the next step.)

---

#### **Step 2: Area 1 → Waste Area**
- **Original Path:** [G4, G3]
- **Start:** G4 (Area 1 valid waypoint)
- **End:** G3 (Waste Area valid waypoint)

**Waypoint Validation:**
- G4: Valid (Area 1)
- G3: Valid (Waste Area)
- Transition: G4 and G3 are adjacent and both listed as valid in their respective area lists.

**No errors found.**

**Final Valid Path:**  
[G4, G3]

---

#### **Step 3: Waste Area → Large Shelf 1**
- **Original Path:** [G3, F3, H2, I2, J2, K2, L2, M2]
- **Start:** G3 (Waste Area valid)
- **End:** M2 (Large Shelf 1 valid)

**Waypoint Validation:**
- G3: Valid (Waste Area)
- F3: Valid (Waste Area)
- H2: **Invalid** (Row H: H2 is on the invalid list)
- I2: **Invalid** (Row I: I2 is on the invalid list)
- J2: **Invalid** (Row J: J2 is on the invalid list)
- K2, L2, M2: Not explicitly invalid

**Errors:**
- H2, I2, J2 are all explicitly invalid.

**Correction:**
Alternate route must bypass these blocked points. Use column 4 as a throughway (as in Step 1). F3 could move to F4, and then take the corridor via L4 and then horizontally.

**Proposed revised path:**
- G3, F3, F4, G4, H4, I4, J4, K4, L4, L2, M2

- F4: Not listed as invalid
- L4: Not listed as invalid
- J4, I4, H4, G4: All valid/allowed

**Final Valid Path:**  
[G3, F3, F4, G4, H4, I4, J4, K4, L4, L2, M2]

---

### Loop Validation for Worker 1
- **M2** (start of Step 1) matches **M2** (end of Step 3): **Closed loop; continuous.**

- G14-G11: Valid (Area 3)
- G10-G7: Valid (Area 2)
- G6-G4: Valid (Area 1)
- G3: Valid (Waste Area)

*All transitions occur via valid area waypoints, in each correct list.*

**Final Valid Path:**  
[G16, G15, G14, G13, G12, G11, G10, G9, G8, G7, G6, G5, G4, G3]

## **Summary of All Validation and Corrections**

**Worker 1:**
- **Step 1:** Corrected route to bypass J2/I2/H2 (all invalid) and enter Area 1 through allowed corridors.
  - **Corrected Path:** [M2, L2, L4, K4, J4, I4, H4, G4]
- **Step 2 & 3:** Route corrections to avoid invalid waypoints; confirmed closed loop, all waypoints area-valid.

**Worker 2:**
- **All Steps:** All waypoints valid; area entry/exit always properly at area-valid points; closed, continuous loop confirmed.

**There are no remaining invalid, blocked, or area-inconsistent waypoints in the corrected worker routes. All transitions are continuous, and all loops are closed.**

You are a warehouse worker route and task reporter. Based on the defined task and navigation sequences for both workers, your job is to output the entire process in the following strict JSON structure:

```json
{{
  "Worker 1 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ],
  "Worker 2 Tasks": [
    {{
      "Task": "<From Zone> → <To Zone>",
      "Start": "<Start Coordinate>",
      "End": "<End Coordinate>",
      "Path": ["<Waypoint List>"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```


You must:

Output only valid JSON, which must be syntactically correct and fully parseable.

Enclose all string values in double quotes.

Format every list using square brackets, with correct comma placement.

For each task, include:
- The zone transition in the "Task" field (e.g., "Boxes 1 → Area 1").
- "Start" and "End" coordinates (e.g., "C9").
- The full list of waypoints in the "Path" array (each as a string, e.g., ["C9", "D9", "E9", "F9"]).

Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the JSON structure.
