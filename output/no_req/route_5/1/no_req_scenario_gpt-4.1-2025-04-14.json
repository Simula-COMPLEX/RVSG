  "scenario": "Two human workers operate in overlapping warehouse zones while an autonomous robot performs waste disposal. Worker 1 retrieves returned items from Large Shelves (Region 4), brings them to Areas 1–2 for inspection, and occasionally discards unusable goods in the Waste Area. Worker 2 transports unsorted goods from Boxes 2–3 (Region 1) to Areas 4–5, sorts them, stages outgoing items for dispatch, and collects disposables for discarding. Both workers move frequently between operational areas, often occupying the same corridors and staging sites used by the robot, creating dynamic, unintentional obstacles. The robot autonomously collects waste from Area 5, traverses Row G leftward (G19 to G3) to the Waste Area, and responds only to physical obstructions caused by ongoing human activities, pausing or rerouting as needed when waypoints or drop-off points are blocked.",
