  "scenario": "During a busy shift, Worker 1 retrieves newly arrived goods from Boxes 2 (Region 1) and Shelf 2 (Region 2), transporting them through the central corridor to Area 1 for inspection and primary sorting. Simultaneously, Worker 2 collects rejected or damaged items from Area 5 (Region 3), using the pallet jack for heavier loads, and periodically inspects and reclassifies materials in Area 2 before moving them to the Waste Area. The autonomous robot begins a disposal task by detecting a new waste item placed in Area 5, then navigates from G19 to G3 along row G to deliver the waste to the Waste Area. Both workers often occupy or move through shared pathways, particularly along row G, sometimes pausing for inspection or staging, occasionally blocking or constraining the robot's route. The robot autonomously responds by stopping or rerouting whenever workers or objects temporarily obstruct its path, ensuring uninterrupted workflow without direct human-robot interaction. This setup realistically captures the complexity and dynamic congestion of mixed human-autonomous warehouse operations.",
